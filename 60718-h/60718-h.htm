  <p>The Ostriches are a very ancient group of birds, and, judging from what we know of their
  anatomy, they must be regarded as representing the most primitive of living birds. With the
  exception of a single group, to be discussed presently, all have lost the power of flight. In
  some, in consequence, the wing has become reduced to a mere vestige. It is a rule in Nature, we
  may remark, that whenever an organ, such as a wing or a leg or a tail, ceases to be useful, it
  undergoes forthwith a slow process of reduction or degeneration, growing smaller and smaller in
  each successive generation, till at last it may even disappear altogether. The loss of flight has
  been accompanied by a degeneration in the quality of the feathers&mdash;that is to say, their
  serviceability as aids to flight has been entirely lost.</p>

  retained the power of flight are known as Tinamous, and are natives of South America. All these
  are smaller than the flightless Apteryx.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Tinamous.</span></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Tinamous</span> should perhaps be regarded as standing at the head of the
  Ostrich Tribe, since they have reached a higher degree of development than any other of its
  members. They have also preserved the power of flight. In their general appearance they bear a
  singular resemblance to partridges, though a little careful observation will reveal many points
  wherein they differ therefrom. They are very confiding and unsuspicious birds&mdash;some persons
  call them stupid <span class="pagenum" id="page386"><span class="smaller">{386}</span></span>on
  this account&mdash;and in the early morning the species inhabiting the Argentine pampas will,
  observers tell us, come right up to the isolated houses of the settlers, so that the boys knock
  them down with stones. The delicate quality of the flesh has caused these birds to be highly
  esteemed as food, and their trustful nature renders them an easy prey, so much so that in some
  districts they have been almost exterminated. Large numbers are caught by riding round them in a
  circle and securing them with a noose. Mr. Hudson, who lived many years in the pampas, assures us
  that the <span class="sc">Great Tinamou</span> is one of the sweetest-voiced of the native birds.
  The song is composed of "five modulated notes, flute-like in character, and very expressive, and
  is uttered by many individuals answering each other as they sit far apart, concealed in the
  grass."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The eggs of the tinamous are to be reckoned among the wonders of bird life, being
  so highly burnished as to look like beautifully glazed porcelain. The colour varies according to
  the species, ranging from wine-red, blue-green, and brown to black. The young are almost as
  remarkable as the eggs, being clothed with a peculiar down, of great complexity of structure, and
  resembling in some respects the nestling down of the true ostrich.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Rhea</span> is a native of South America. It is frequently referred to as
  the <span class="sc">South American Ostrich</span>, and also as the <span class="sc">Nandu</span>.
  The resemblance which it bears to the true ostrich is striking, but it may at once be
  distinguished therefrom by the fact that it has three toes and a feathered head and neck;
  furthermore, it is smaller in size, and lacks the conspicuous white wing- and tail-plumes. The
  tail, indeed, as may be seen from the photographs reproduced is wanting. The rhea must be regarded
  as standing at the head of the flightless members of the Ostrich Tribe. Its wings, though not
  large enough to raise its heavy body from the ground, are yet of considerable size.</p>

  <p>In Buenos Aires rheas are hunted with dogs. If a breeze is blowing, the birds raise one wing,
  which acts as a sail. This done, they can acquire a speed which makes it absolutely impossible for
  either dog or horse to come up with them. The only chance of ultimately capturing them is by
  wearing them out <span class="pagenum" id="page387"><span class="smaller">{387}</span></span>by
  ceaseless pursuit. A chase of this kind may last an hour and a half. Needless to say, for sport of
  this kind both horses and dogs must be the best of their kind and in "good form." The natives and
  Indians hunt them on horseback with the "bolas." The bolas, or balls, used for this purpose
  consist of two round stones covered with leather, and united by a thong of about 8 feet long. One
  of these is held in the hand and the other whirled round the head and suddenly released, when both
  go whirling madly round till they strike the rhea's legs, around which they instantly twist, and
  the victim is a fast prisoner.</p>

  <p>The rhea is in danger of disappearing altogether as a wild bird, owing to the ruthless
  slaughter which is made upon it for the sake of its feathers. For some years back, Mr. Harting
  tells us, "the number of birds killed has averaged 400,000 per annum, and, as a consequence, the
  species has already disappeared from nearly half the territory of the River Plate." On some
  estates in Argentina the wild birds are driven in and plucked.</p>

  <p>Like most of the Ostrich Tribe, the male alone performs the duties of incubation, hatching some
  twenty eggs at a time, the produce of several different females. There are three different kinds
  of rhea, but they do not differ much one from another. The young are curiously striped. The egg is
  very large, of a cream colour, and deeply pitted.</p>

  <p>Darwin, in his "Voyage of the Beagle," tells us that when he was "at Bahia Blanca, in the
  months of September and October, the eggs, in extraordinary numbers, were found all over the
  country. They lie either scattered and single, in which case they are never hatched, and are
  called by the Spaniards huachos; or they are collected together into a shallow excavation which
  forms the nest. Out of the four nests which I saw, three contained twenty-two eggs each, and the
  fourth twenty-seven. In one day's hunting on horseback sixty-four eggs were found: forty-four of
  these were in two nests, and the remaining twenty scattered huachos. The Gauchos unanimously
  affirm&mdash;and there is no reason to doubt their statement&mdash;that the male bird alone
  hatches the eggs, and for some time afterwards accompanies the young. The cock, when on the nest,
  lies very close: I have myself almost ridden over one. It is asserted that at such times they are
  occasionally fierce and even dangerous, and that they have been known <span class="pagenum"
  id="page388"><span class="smaller">{388}</span></span>to attack a man on horseback, trying to kick
  and leap on him. My informer pointed out to me an old man whom he had seen much terrified by one
  chasing him.... I understand that the male emu in the Zoological Gardens takes charge of the nest:
  this habit, therefore, is common to the family.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">"The Gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest. I have been
  positively told that four or five hen birds have been watched to go, in the middle of the day, one
  after another, to the same nest.... Although this habit at first appears very strange, I think the
  cause may be explained in a simple manner. The number of eggs in the nest varies from twenty to
  forty, and even fifty; and according to Azara even seventy or eighty. Now, although it is most
  probable, from the number of the eggs found in one district being so extraordinarily great in
  proportion to the parent birds, and likewise from the state of the ovarium of the hen, that she
  may, in the course of the season, lay a large number, yet the time required must be very long....
  If the hen was obliged to hatch her own eggs before the last was laid, the first probably would be
  addled; but if each laid a few eggs at successive periods in different nests, and several hens ...
  combined together, then the eggs in one collection would be nearly of the same age. If the number
  of eggs in one of these nests is, as I believe, not greater on an average than the number laid by
  one female in the season, then there must be as many nests as females, and each cock bird will
  have its fair share of the labour of incubation; and that during a period when the females
  probably could not sit, from not having finished laying. I have before mentioned the great number
  of huachos, or deserted eggs; and that in one day's hunting twenty were found in this state. It
  appears odd that so many should be wasted. Does it not arise from the difficulty of several
  females <span class="pagenum" id="page389"><span class="smaller">{389}</span></span>associating
  together, and finding a male ready to undertake the office of incubation? It is obvious that there
  must at first be some degree of association between at least two females, otherwise the eggs would
  remain scattered over the wide plains, at distances far too great to allow of the male collecting
  them into one nest: some ... have believed that the scattered eggs were deposited for the young
  birds to feed on. This can hardly be the case ... because huachos, although often found addled and
  putrid, are generally whole."</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Ostrich.</span></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Ostrich</span> is the giant amongst living birds, the full-grown male
  standing some 8 feet high, and weighing about 300 lbs. It is flightless, the wings being smaller,
  in proportion to the size of the body, than in the rhea. But the energy which in other birds is
  employed in sustaining flight in the ostrich is expended in running, so that it has reached a high
  degree of speed&mdash;no less, in fact, than twenty-six miles an hour. When at full speed, it is
  generally believed the ostrich derives no small help from the wings, which are used sail-wise. Nor
  is this belief by any means a modern one, for all of us must be familiar with Job's observations
  on this subject: "What time she lifteth up her wings on high, she scorneth the horse and his
  rider." The wings are never used in running at full speed, but are of much service in turning,
  "enabling the bird to double abruptly, even when going at top speed." In justice to the older
  observers, however, it must be remarked that ostriches do run with raised wings, but only at the
  commencement of the run, or in covering a short distance, when the pace may be considerable; but
  if circumstances demand "full speed ahead," they are held close to the body, where they offer the
  least resistance to speed.</p>

      <p class="sp0">In a wild state both cock and hen take part in the preparation of the nest.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>With the gradual perfection of its running powers, there has followed a gradual change in the
  form of the leg. This change has taken place by reduction in the number of the toes. Of the
  original five with which its ancestors began life only two now remain&mdash;the third and fourth.
  The third is of great size, having apparently waxed great at the expense of the other toes, a
  growth which seems to be still in progress, inasmuch as the fourth toe is undoubtedly dwindling.
  It is very small, and gives unmistakable signs of growing smaller, since it has now become
  nailless. When it has quite disappeared, the ostrich, like the horse, will have but a single toe
  on each foot&mdash;the third. The dainty, mincing step of the ostrich is a delight to watch, and,
  thanks to the Zoological Gardens, this can be done even in smoky London.</p>

  <p>The ostrich, like its cousin of South America, the rhea, commonly associates with herds of the
  larger mammalia. On the South African veldt the companions of the ostrich are the zebra,
  wildebeest, and hartebeest, just as on the pampas of South America the rheas are found associated
  with herds of deer and guanaco.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page390"><span class="smaller">{390}</span></span></div>

  <p>The egg of the ostrich weighs about 3 lbs., and is of delicious flavour. The empty shell, it
  has been found by experiment, is large enough to hold the contents of eighteen eggs of the common
  domesticated fowl. It takes about forty minutes to boil an ostrich egg hard. About fifteen eggs
  represent the clutch. The nest is a mere depression in the sand. The hen sits by day, and her mate
  by night; but the eggs are <i>never</i> left, as is sometimes stated, to the heat of the sun, so
  as to lessen the duties of the parent. Such a course would infallibly destroy the eggs, for the
  sun's rays, especially at noon, are very powerful.</p>

  <p>The male and female ostrich differ much in coloration. In the former the trunk is clothed in a
  vestment of richest black, whilst the quills of the wings and tail-feathers are of pure white:
  they form the much-prized ostrich plumes. The female is much less splendid, being clothed in sober
  grey. But these colours are not merely ornamental; they render the male by night and the female by
  day invisible, owing to the perfect harmony they make with their surroundings, thus affording an
  interesting illustration of protective coloration.</p>

  <p>"All ostriches," says Mr. Cronwright Schreiner, "adults as well as chicks, have a strange habit
  known as 'waltzing.' When chicks are let out from a kraal in the early morning, they will often
  start away at a great pace. After running for a few hundred yards they will all stop, and, with
  wings raised, spin round rapidly for some time, often till quite giddy, when a broken leg
  occasionally occurs. Adult birds, when running in large camps, will often, if the veldt is good,
  do the same, especially if startled in the fresh of the early morning. A troop of birds waltzing,
  in full plumage, is a remarkably pretty sight. Vicious cocks 'roll' when challenging to fight,
  also when wooing the hen. The cock will suddenly bump down on to his 'knees' ... open his wings,
  making a straight line across his breast, and then swing them alternately backwards and forwards
  ... as if on a pivot, each wing, as it comes forward, being raised, while that going backward is
  depressed. The neck is lowered until the head is on a level with the back, and the head and neck
  swing from side to side with the wings, the back of the head striking with a loud click against
  the ribs, first on the one side and then on the other. The click is produced by the skin of the
  neck, which then bulges loosely just under the beak and for some distance downwards. While
  'rolling,' every feather over the whole body is on end, and the plumes are open, like a large
  white fan. At such a time the bird sees very imperfectly, if at all; in fact, he seems so
  preoccupied that, if pursued, one may often approach unnoticed. I have walked up to a 'rolling'
  cock and seized him by the neck, much to his surprise. Just before rolling, a cock, especially if
  courting the hen, will often run slowly and daintily on the points of his toes, with neck slightly
  inflated, upright and rigid, the tail half drooped, and all his body-feathers fluffed up; the
  wings raised and expanded, the inside edges touching the sides of the neck for nearly the whole of
  its length, and the plumes showing separately, like an open fan ... on each side of his head. In

  gradient. The bird, as soon as he caught sight of the train, at once got on the line, "and
  advanced fearlessly to fight the monster. As the screeching engine approached, he rushed at it
  from straight in front, hissing angrily, and kicked. He was cut to pieces the next moment."</p>

  <p>The Bedouin tribes hunt the ostrich on dromedaries, so also do the natives of Somaliland, and
  when near enough shoot it with poisoned arrows. In the Sahara, Canon Tristram tells us it is
  ridden down on horseback, a method of capture which the Sahara sportsman regards as the greatest
  feat of hunting.</p>

  <p>"The Bushmen," says Mr. Harting, "like the Somalis, kill the ostrich with poisoned arrows, or
  catch it very cleverly in pit-falls or with the lasso, and the Sukurieh and Hadendawah tribes
  likewise use the lasso, with which the bird, when once fairly caught, is strangled.... A favourite
  plan is to wait for the birds in a place of concealment, as near as possible to the pools to which
  they come for water, and then, with a gun loaded with swan-shot, to fire at their necks as they
  stoop to drink, when perhaps half a dozen are laid low at once.... Another plan to which the
  Bushman often resorts is simpler still. Having found an ostrich's nest, he removes all the eggs,
  and, ensconcing himself in the nest, quietly awaits the return of the bird, which he shoots with a
  poisoned arrow before it has time to recover from its surprise at finding him there instead of the
  eggs.... In Senaar the Ab&ucirc;-R&ocirc;f bring it down by throwing a curved flat stick from 2&frac12; to 3 feet
  long, not unlike the Australian boomerang, and made of tough acacia-wood or hard zizyphus."</p>

  <p>Mr. Arthur Glynn, of Leydenburg, gives a graphic description of an ostrich hunt, his quarry
  being a troop of twenty birds&mdash;"on sighting which," he tells us, "we immediately gave chase,
  discovering directly afterwards that a single bull wildebeeste was among them. After a stiff
  gallop," he says, "of half a mile, we got within seventy yards of the troop; so reining in, we
  both dismounted and fired, bringing down one ostrich and the wildebeeste bull.... We quickly
  mounted and continued the pursuit, the ostriches never running for any distance in a direct <span
  class="pagenum" id="page393"><span class="smaller">{393}</span></span>course, but always turning
  and twisting, which made it difficult for us to keep them in sight.... We went sailing on, neck
  and neck, regardless of holes or anything else, only thinking of the grandly plumaged birds in
  front of us, our horses straining every nerve to overtake them, as only old stagers know how to
  run when in pursuit of game. We had now approached within fifty yards, and, jumping down, we fired
  at two cock birds running separately from the troop, bringing them both down. Hastily mounting, we
  continued on after the retreating troop; but at this juncture my friend's horse trod in a hole,
  sending his rider over his head, thereby completely putting him out of the run. I now continued
  the chase by myself. For a mile the ostriches gained on me, as they continued to run in a straight
  line, thereby not enabling me to cut off any point, but obliging me to keep in their rear all the
  time.... I got off twice, and fired several fruitless shots, and then continued the chase for
  certainly two miles without dismounting once.... I now got within a hundred yards, and jumped
  down.... The first shot I fired brought down a fine cock bird, but the second struck the ground
  over the others, turning them to the right along a low ridge. They appeared very much exhausted,
  and ran with their wings spread out.... I saw that they were coming direct for me, and waited
  until they were close.... When the ostriches approached within fifteen yards, I selected the
  best-looking bird, and put a bullet through him. He ran on for about twenty yards and fell
  dead."</p>

      <p class="sp0">This bird is not yet full grown, the horny casque on the top of the head being
      much larger in the adult.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Cassowaries and Emeus.</span></p>

  <p>With the Cassowaries and Emeus we have come as near as we can get at the present day to the
  representatives of the ancient type from which the Ostrich Tribe have sprung. But both these forms
  are to be regarded as having passed the prime of their development, for, like their allies which
  we have already considered, they have lost the power of flight. Both emeu and cassowary possess,
  when adult, one character shared by no other living adult bird: they have what may be called
  double feathers, each feather possessing two shafts of equal length. They appear to follow a
  custom of their own in the matter of the coloration of their eggs, since these are never white,
  like those of the rhea or ostrich, but green, with a very rough surface. The young, like those of
  the rhea, are striped with alternate black and white stripes. The emeu is found only on the
  continent of Australia; the cassowary occurs both in Australia and on the neighbouring islands of
  New Guinea, Ceram, and Aru.</p>

  <p>The lot of the <span class="sc">Cassowary</span> appears to have been cast in pleasant places,
  making it possible <span class="pagenum" id="page394"><span class="smaller">{394}</span></span>to
  indulge in the luxury of personal decoration&mdash;a decoration, moreover, shared equally by the
  males and females, both sexes having the head and neck most brilliantly coloured. In some species
  all the hues of the rainbow are vividly reflected. To show these colours, the feathery covering,
  still worn by their relatives on the distant continents of Africa and America, has been cast off
  and the skin left bare. To these gorgeous hues they have added yet other features, for the head is
  surmounted in many species by a huge casque, or helmet; whilst from the neck depend curious fleshy
  lobes, or wattles, coloured in accordance with the rest of the bare, coloured skin of this region.
  Then, too, they have effected quite a novel transformation in the quills of the wing, for these
  project on either side of the body in a series of shining black spines. Nor is this all, for over
  and above the energy which they have to spare for personal decoration is a very large reserve to
  be expended in fighting. The males are very pugnacious, and to give point to this pugnacity they
  wear a very formidable weapon on the inner toe in the shape of a huge nail, which can inflict a
  really dangerous wound. It is used in kicking, the foot being brought forwards and downwards with
  incredible speed and great force. When wounded, these powerful birds are very dangerous to
  approach. "On more than one occasion a wounded bird has caused a naturalist to take to a tree. The
  sharp nail of the inner toe is a most dangerous weapon, quite equal to the claw of a large
  kangaroo, and capable of doing quite as much execution."</p>

  <p>Although forest-haunting birds&mdash;wherein they differ from their allies, which are

  The Australian cassowary is already decreasing sadly, being persecuted for the sake of its skin,

      <p class="sp0">Young emeus just out of the shell have the legs beautifully spotted, but these

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Emeu</span>, though a sort of cousin of the cassowary, boasts none of its
  splendour; on the contrary, it is a dull, dowdy-looking bird. In size, however, it is much larger
  than the cassowary. The wings, which are exceedingly small, have numerous tiny
  quill-feathers&mdash;not long, hard spines, as in the cassowary. When in captivity, it exhibits
  great curiosity; furthermore, it is swift to realise symptoms of fear in the faces of any visitor
  whom it may have under inspection. Occasionally fear turns into flight, and then, thoroughly
  entering into the joke, the emeu pursues at top speed. Needless to say, hunting of this kind can
  only be done in fairly large paddocks or parks; but emeus are frequently so kept.</p>

  <p>A very remarkable and quite unique structure in the emeu is a curious bag or pouch, formed by a
  sort of out-pocketing of the inner lining of the windpipe. Emerging through a long slit caused by
  the incompleteness of some of the rings near the middle of the windpipe, the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page395"><span class="smaller">{395}</span></span>pouch comes to lie between this tube and the
  skin. Strangely enough, it is found only in the female, and is used by her chiefly during the
  breeding-season, when she utters a peculiarly loud booming note, which, it is supposed, is caused
  by the manipulation of the air in the pouch. When moved by any gentle excitement or pleasure,
  especially on damp evenings or in the dead of night, she also becomes musical, giving forth a note
  which has been likened to a gong or muffled drum. The male, which is smaller, fleeter of foot, and
  more docile and inquisitive, is mute, or at most gives forth a suppressed hiss when angry, or a
  kind of grunt when distressed.</p>

  <p>At one time the emeu roamed over the whole of the mainland of Australia; but now, alas! it is
  almost exterminated, being found only far inland and in steadily diminishing numbers. Swift of
  foot and of great powers of endurance, the emeu has afforded in the past much "sport" to the
  hunting-man, who followed the dogs, doubtless making comparisons the while between his two-legged
  prey and his four-footed friend Reynard. The hunt does not end till the bird is thoroughly
  exhausted, when it must be seized at once by the neck, in order to prevent it kicking, for the
  legs are so powerful that a blow from the foot is dangerous.</p>

  <p>Incubation is apparently performed by the male, which sits from fifty-four to sixty-four days.
  Practically no nest is made, only a shallow hollow being scraped in the sand. The eggs, from seven
  to thirteen in number, are of a dark bottle-green colour, sometimes lighter, and have the surfaces
  curiously roughened. The male is smaller than the female, a fact which has led to some confusion,
  the larger female having at one time been regarded as the male. It will be noted that the emeus
  not only lack the brilliant colour of the cassowaries, but also the helmet, or casque.</p>

  <p>The late Mr. Gould's remarks on the edibility of the emeu are interesting. He says: "Its flesh
  has been compared to coarse beef, which it resembles, according to Mr. Cunningham, both in
  appearance and taste, and is good and sweet eating; nothing, indeed, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page396"><span class="smaller">{396}</span></span>can be more delicate than the flesh of the
  young ones. There is little fit for culinary use upon any part of the emu, except the
  hindquarters, which are of such dimensions that the shouldering of the two hind legs homeward for
  a mile distance once proved to me as tiresome a task as I ever recollect to have encountered in
  the colony. I may remark that its flesh proved of the greatest service to Dr. Leichardt and his
  intrepid companions during their overland route from Moreton Bay to Port Essington, in the course
  of which, but more particularly between the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria and Port Essington,
  the sight and capture of the emu was almost a daily occurrence; so abundant, in fact, was it, that
  he states that he saw in the short space of eight miles at least a hundred, in flocks of three,
  five, ten, and even more at a time. On the continent of Australia the emu was formerly abundant
  about Botany Bay and Port Jackson Harbour, but is now only to be seen in the plains of the
  interior, over whose solitudes it roams in great numbers, and where it breeds, depending on the
  strength and swiftness of its legs to avoid the pursuit of the stockmen and their dogs. Farther
  and farther back, however, will it be driven, until it be extirpated, unless some law be
  instituted to check its wanton destruction."</p>

  <p>It is not easy in a few words exactly to define a "game-bird." Anatomical details aside, the
  most characteristic features are the small head and moderately long neck, and a compact body, in
  which the wings, when folded, are almost entirely concealed. The hind toe is always present, and
  the claws are adapted for scratching purposes&mdash;that is to say, for scratching up the surface
  of the ground in the search for seeds as food. The wings are hollowed so as to fit close to the
  body, and the flight, which is noisy and never long-sustained, is nevertheless often exceedingly
  rapid. The young are hatched covered with down, and able to run in a few hours after birth.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Red Grouse</span> is the only game-bird which is not found outside the
  British Islands. It is the bird which perhaps heads the list in the estimation of British
  sportsmen, who travel north in hundreds every year for the pleasure of the sport it affords. It is
  furthermore remarkable for the wonderful variety of the seasonal plumages. Both sexes change their
  dress twice during the year&mdash;the female in spring and summer, and the male in autumn and
  winter. Its Continental relative, the <span class="sc">Ryper</span>, has no less than three
  changes&mdash;spring, summer, and winter. For the last season a white dress is adopted, to
  correspond with its snowy surroundings. The winters in the British Islands are neither long enough
  nor severe enough to render such change necessary with the red grouse, which is sufficiently
  protected by its ordinary dress.</p>

      <p class="sp3">COMMON PARTRIDGE.</p>
      <p class="sp0">This is the commoner and more esteemed of the two species of British
      partridges.</p>

  <p>In the spring the capercallie, like the blackcock, indulges in a remarkable "love-song," or
  "play," as it is called. With outstretched neck, tail expanded like a fan, drooping wings, and
  ruffled feathers, he commences his call, "peller, peller, peller," increasing in rapidity every
  moment, till he works himself up into a perfect frenzy. At this time he is perfectly unconscious
  of all around him, and poachers, knowing this, sometimes take advantage to creep up and shoot him.
  On hearing the cock, the hens assemble from all parts of the forest. The male then descends from
  the tree to the ground, when "he and his <span class="pagenum" id="page399"><span
  class="smaller">{399}</span></span>female friends join company" and march away. The capercallie is
  jealous of trespassers on his domain, and instances are on record where people have been attacked
  when so infringing.</p>

  <p>Like the capercallie, the <span class="sc">Blackcock</span> must be sought in the woods, whence
  he sallies forth to the moors and stubble-fields to feed. The <span class="sc">Grey-hen</span>, as
  the female of this species is called, lays from six to ten eggs, of a buff colour, spotted with
  rich brown: both in number and colour they resemble those of the capercallie.</p>

  <p>The naturalist Brehm gives a delightful account of the love-making of this bird. During the
  spring, he says, "the bird utters almost continuously the strangest noises. He holds his tail up
  and spreads it out like a fan, he lifts up his head and neck with all the feathers erect, and
  stretches his wings from the body. Then he takes a few jumps in different directions, sometimes in
  a circle, and presses the under part of his beak so hard against the ground that the chin-feathers
  are rubbed off. During these movements he beats his wings and turns round and round. The more
  ardent he grows, the more lively he becomes, until at last the bird appears like a frantic
  creature. At such times the blackcocks are so absorbed that they become almost blind and deaf, but
  less so than the capercallie."</p>

  <p>North America is very rich in large forms of grouse; and one of the most interesting of these
  is the <span class="sc">Prairie-hen</span>, remarkable for the possession of a pair of curious
  bags of a bright orange colour on each side of the neck, which can be inflated with air at
  will.</p>

  <p>"Early in the morning," writes Captain Bendire of the prairie-hen, "you may see them assemble
  in parties, from a dozen to fifty together, on some dry knolls ... and their goings-on would make
  you laugh. The air-sacs are their ornaments, which they display ... before the gentler sex by
  blowing them up till they look like two ripe oranges ... projecting their long, black ears right
  forward, ruffling up all the feathers of the body till they stand out straight, and dropping their
  wings on the ground like a turkey-cock.... Then it is that the proud cock, in order to complete
  his triumph, will rush forward at his best speed ... through the midst of the love-sick damsels,
  pouring out as he goes a booming noise ... <span class="pagenum" id="page400"><span
  class="smaller">{400}</span></span>which may be heard for at least two miles in the still morning
  air. Every few minutes this display is repeated ... but they seem careful not to run against each
  other, for they have not yet got to the fighting-point. After a little while the lady birds begin
  to show an interest in the proceedings, by moving about quickly a few yards at a time, and then
  standing still a short time. When these actions are continued by a large number of birds at a
  time, it presents a funny sight, and you can easily think they are moving to the measure of
  music."</p>

  <p>The prairie-hens of America possess great economic value, as great, indeed, as the red grouse
  of the British Islands, enormous numbers of prairie-hens being exported to Europe every year,
  whilst still greater numbers are consumed by the American people themselves. It is said that
  American grouse will sometimes eat the shoots of a plant called <i>kalmia</i>, which renders the
  flesh poisonous.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sage-grouse</span> is a rather large bird, attaining a weight of 8 lbs.,
  found in the Western United States; it is, indeed, the largest of the American grouse. Its
  courting habits resemble those of the prairie-hens. From the book containing the above lively

  <p>"Early one morning in the first week in March, 1877, I had the long-wished-for opportunity to
  observe the actions of a single cock while paying court to several females near him.... His large,
  pale yellow air-sacs were fully inflated, and not only extended forward but apparently upward as
  well, rising at least an inch above his head, which consequently was scarcely noticeable, giving
  the bird an exceedingly peculiar appearance. He looked decidedly top-heavy and ready to topple
  over on the slightest provocation." He then proceeds to describe the further preparations designed
  for conquest. The tail is spread fan-wise, and animated with a peculiar quivering motion, whilst
  the wings are trailed upon the ground. When the correct position has been assumed, he advances
  with stately, hesitating steps towards his mate, uttering, as he moves, "low, grunting, guttural
  sounds" resembling those of a purring cat, but louder. This, apparently, is the prescribed method
  of courting; of many suitors, he is selected who performs best.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <span class="sc">Ruffed Grouse</span>, like the prairie-hen, has the neck, in
  the male, ornamented with a frill of long feathers. Like many other birds, the female, when
  danger, in the shape of prowling beasts, threatens her eggs or young, simulates lameness. So soon
  as the enemy approaches near enough to be dangerous, up she gets with a great noise of wings, and
  then flutters along the ground as though wounded. The would-be captor is thus led far from the
  jealously guarded treasures, and when a safe distance has been covered an end is speedily put to
  this will-o'-the-wisp chase by the bird suddenly taking wing.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Partridges, Quails, and Pheasants.</span></p>

  <p>The birds which come under this head are so many in number they may be reckoned by the hundred,
  and include several forms of exquisite beauty. The legs of many are armed with formidable spurs,
  with which the males, who are exceedingly pugnacious, fight furiously with their rivals for the
  possession of some coveted female.</p>

  <p>Of the more conspicuous forms we may mention the <span class="sc">Red-legged</span> and <span
  class="sc">Common Partridges</span>. In England the former is known more generally as the <span
  class="sc">French Partridge</span>&mdash;why, it is hard to say. It is a native of South-eastern
  Europe, whence it was introduced towards the end of the eighteenth century. It is a handsome bird,
  but not in high favour with sportsmen, since it prefers to escape by running rather than by
  flight.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page403"><span class="smaller">{403}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Common Partridge</span> is the more abundant of the two species. Though
  more sober in coloration, it is still a beautiful bird. The "horse-shoe" mark, borne on the
  breast, so characteristic of this bird, is <i>not</i> confined to the males, as is generally
  believed. "Yielding," says Professor Newton, "perhaps in economic importance to the red grouse,
  what may be called the social influence of the partridge is greater than that excited by any other
  wild bird."</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This bird displays great courage and affection in defence of its eggs or young. A story
  illustrating this is told of a gentleman near Spilsby, in Lincolnshire, who, "whilst
  superintending his ploughmen, saw a partridge glide off her nest, so near the foot of one of his
  plough-horses that he thought the eggs must be crushed; this, however, was not the case.... He saw
  the old bird return to her nest the instant he left the spot. It was evident that the next round
  of the plough must bury the eggs and nest in the furrow. His surprise was great when, returning
  with the plough, he came to the spot and saw the nest indeed, but the eggs and bird were gone. An
  idea struck him that she had removed her eggs; and he found her, before he left the field, sitting
  under the hedge upon twenty-one eggs.... The round of ploughing had occupied about twenty minutes,
  in which time she, probably aided by the cock bird, had removed the twenty-one eggs to a distance
  of about forty yards."</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Red-legged Partridges</span>, their allies the <span
  class="sc">Francolins</span>, and the <span class="sc">Grey Partridges</span> are all
  ground-birds; the <span class="sc">Tree-partridges</span>, as the name implies, are not, or at
  least less completely so&mdash;hence their mention here. They are natives of the Indo-Chinese
  countries, and the islands of Java, Borneo, and Formosa.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Quail</span> is a little-known British bird, very like a small partridge
  in appearance. Enormous numbers, Professor Newton tells us, "are netted on the Continent,
  especially in the spring migration. The captives are exposed in the poulterers' shops, confined in
  long, cloth-covered cages, with a feeding-trough in front." The bulk "of these are males, which
  are the first to arrive, and advantage is taken of this circumstance by the bird-catchers, who
  decoy hundreds into their nets by imitating the call-note of the female. It has been stated that
  in the small island of Capri, in the Bay of Naples, 160,000 have been netted in a single season,
  and even larger numbers are on record." An idea of the vast numbers which travel together in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page404"><span class="smaller">{404}</span></span>migration may be gathered
  from Canon Tristram's statement that in Algeria, in April, he found the ground covered with quails
  for an extent of many acres at daybreak, where on the preceding afternoon not one was to be seen.
  These are the birds which were so eagerly seized by the Israelites as a welcome change in the diet
  which had become so monotonous in the days of their early wanderings. The story, so vividly told
  in the Book of Exodus, is, of course, familiar to all.</p>

  <p>The quail lays from nine to fifteen eggs in a feeble apology for a nest. It is said that the
  curious metallic note "clic-lic-lic" gave origin to the Spanish castanet, for these birds are much
  esteemed in Spain, being kept in cages for the pleasure their notes afford.</p>

  <p>There are five or six other species of quail closely related to the above. The British bird
  enjoys an enormous range, being found almost everywhere in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The so-called
  <span class="sc">American Quails</span>&mdash;some forty species in number&mdash;are generally
  regarded as belonging to a distinct group.</p>

  <p>That ornament to all rural scenery, the <span class="sc">Pheasant</span>, is said to have been
  introduced from the banks of the river Phasis, in Colchis, Transcaucasia, by the Romans&mdash;at
  least, the original form of pheasant was. Late during the eighteenth century a Japanese and a
  Chinese form were introduced, and these have freely interbred with the original form, so that
  pure-bred specimens of any of the three are rare.</p>

  <p>The speed of a pheasant on the wing in full flight has been estimated at thirty-eight miles an
  hour. Occasionally pheasants will take to the water, and are said to swim well.</p>

  <p>The number of pheasants reared by hand at the present day is prodigious. In 1883, Professor
  Newton tells us, 134,000 pheasants' eggs were sold from one estate in Norfolk, while 9,700 fully
  grown birds were killed upon it. In olden times pheasants were taken in snares or nets, by
  hawking, and by the cross-bow; but on the introduction of guns these methods were superseded.</p>

  <p>Yet another form of pheasant has been introduced into Britain of late years. This is <span
  class="sc">Reeves's Pheasant</span>, a truly magnificent bird, with a tail fully 5 feet long in
  adult males. These birds also interbreed with the more common forms, but not freely.</p>

  <p>Beautiful as these pheasants undoubtedly are, they are eclipsed by many of their relatives.
  Among the most noteworthy of these we may notice the magnificent <span
  class="sc">Tragopans</span>. Rich in coloration of the feathers, these birds have added an
  additional feature in brilliantly coloured areas of bare skin on the head and neck, which are
  furthermore rendered conspicuous by being developed with "horns" and wattles. These "horns" can be
  erected at will, a process which causes them at the same time to be greatly increased in size. The
  bird, with a proud consciousness of his beauty, displays his charms to the full when wooing. Mr
  Bartlett tells us that, "after walking about rather excitedly, he places himself in front of the
  female, with the body slightly crouching upon the legs, and the tail bent downwards; the head is
  then violently jerked downwards, and the horns and wattle become conspicuous. The wings have a
  flapping motion, and the bright red patch on them is fully displayed. The whole of the neck
  appears to be larger than usual during this action, so do the horns, which, moreover, vibrate with
  every motion. This scene is concluded by the bird suddenly drawing himself up to his full height,
  with his wings expanded and quivering, the horns erect, and the wattles fully displayed."</p>

  <p>Equally splendid, some think more so, are the four species of pheasant known as <span
  class="sc">Monals</span> or <span class="sc">Impeyan Pheasants</span>. The plumage in this case
  looks like burnished metal rather than feathers. The head is adorned with a crest either of long
  or beautifully curled feathers. Monals are found in the same haunts as the tragopans&mdash;the
  highest forest regions of the Himalaya.</p>

  <p class="sp3">But the most gorgeous of all the Pheasant Tribe are perhaps the <span
  class="sc">Golden Pheasants</span>. The crimson body and exquisitely beautiful collar of gold
  barred with black constitute a perfectly royal livery. Since, however, these are amongst the
  commonest occupants of the aviary, we need not describe them further here. They are natives of
  China and Tibet.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Jungle-fowl and their Domesticated Descendants.</span></p>

  <p>These birds, of which there are four distinct species, are close allies of the domesticated
  fowls: the descent of these latter, indeed, is traced from the red jungle-fowl of the Himalaya and
  Central India. The characteristic features of the group are the naked head, bearing the familiar
  wattles and fleshy comb, and the formidable spurs on the legs.</p>

  <p>The varieties of the domesticated jungle-fowl are numerous. The pugnacity of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page407"><span class="smaller">{407}</span></span>members known as the <span
  class="sc">Game-breed</span> is well known, and in the days of cock-fighting large sums of money
  changed hands over the fierce battles waged by rival game-cocks pitted one against the
  other&mdash;the game-cock, it should be remarked, being the little-modified descendant of the red
  jungle-cock.</p>

  <p>The modern game-cock is purely a show-bird, breeders having changed the type by selecting
  characters which would render the bird quite unable to hold its own if matched in battle with one
  of the original breed.</p>

  <p>Very different from the wild ancestor is the huge, much-feathered <span
  class="sc">Cochin</span>. This was introduced into England, not from Cochin-China, as is popularly
  supposed, but from Shanghai, some fifty years ago. At that time this bird enjoyed the reputation
  of being wonderfully prolific. This is, alas! no longer a feature of the breed. The show-pen is
  apparently responsible for this, attention having been paid rather to external appearance than to
  useful qualities.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Plymouth Rock</span> and <span class="sc">Dorking</span> are both
  well-known breeds. The former is of American origin, made by crossing Cochins with a native
  breed&mdash;the Dominique.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Black Spanish</span>, <span class="sc">Minorcas</span>, <span
  class="sc">Leghorns</span>, <span class="sc">Andalusians</span>, etc., constitute what are known
  as the Mediterranean breeds. They are noted for their great prolificacy. This has been gained by
  carefully breeding from the most productive birds, but with the result that the instinct to sit
  has been lost entirely. This is a matter of no consequence, however, as when chicks are required
  there are plenty of "broody" hens of other breeds which can be made to undertake the duties of
  foster-mother.</p>

  <p>A very old breed is the <span class="sc">Polish</span>. It figures often in the pictures of the
  old Dutch masters. One of its chief characteristics is the huge crest of feathers rising from the
  crown of the head. The development of this crest has had a very extraordinary effect upon the
  conformation of the bones of the skull, entirely altering the shape of the brain-case.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most artificial of all breeds of fowl are the <span class="sc">Sebright
  Bantams</span>. These are diminutive birds, the result of a cross between the Polish with "laced"
  feathers and a bantam. The feathers of this cross are beautifully "laced"&mdash;that is, they are
  white, edged with black. Another interesting diminutive breed is the <span class="sc">Japanese
  Bantam</span>. The cock carries its tail, which is long, remarkably high, giving a very quaint
  effect. This breed is further interesting, since it furnishes us with an instance of the breeder's
  power of localising colour by selection. The tail is black and the body white. Yet another
  interesting Japanese fowl is the remarkable long-tailed breed in which the tail-coverts grow
  continuously, attaining a length of from 9 feet to, it is said, 18 feet. The birds are kept for
  show purposes. The greater part of their lives is passed tethered on high perches. Once a day they
  are taken down for exercise, when the long feathers are carefully rolled up and securely fastened
  out of harm's way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Argus-pheasant and Peacock and their Allies.</span></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Argus-pheasant</span> most certainly demands notice, on account of the
  extraordinary development of the wing-quills, which are nearly a yard long, and the wondrous
  beauty of the pattern thereon. This pattern takes the form of a number of eyes, so shaded as to
  give the appearance, when fully displayed, of a number of balls lying in a socket. These enormous
  quills are borne only by the male, and used, like the ornamental feathers of its allies, in
  captivating the female. When fully displayed, the two wings are spread out to form one huge fan,
  producing an effect which words cannot adequately describe. The argus-pheasants are found in the
  forests of Siam, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra, and are excessively wary birds.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Peacock</span> is too well known to need a very long description. But a
  word as to the so-called "tail." This magnificent wealth <span class="pagenum" id="page409"><span
  class="smaller">{409}</span></span>of plumes does not represent the tail, as is popularly
  supposed, but is made up of the feathers of the lower part of the back and the upper tail-coverts.
  These gradually increase in length from before-backwards, culminating in the long and exquisite
  feathers which form the circumference of the huge, outspread shield. This shield is properly
  called the "train"; the true tail lies behind it and acts as a support. When the bird is about to
  display, the "train" feathers are slowly and gently raised till the well-known fan-shaped glory of
  green and gold and blue is exposed to the fullest possible extent.</p>

  <p>"Watch the bird trying to do his best to persuade his chosen what a handsome fellow he is. He
  first places himself more or less in front of her, but at some little distance off; and then,
  watching his opportunity, walks rapidly backwards, going faster and faster and faster, till,
  arrived within a foot, he suddenly, like a flash, turns round and displays to the full his truly
  gorgeous vestments. This turning movement is accompanied by a violent shaking of the train, the
  quills of which rattle like the pattering of rain upon leaves. Often this movement is followed by
  a loud scream.</p>

  <p>"When the train is fully erect, it will be noticed that it lies so far forward that the bird's

  <p>Brief mention will serve for the <span class="sc">Guinea-fowls</span> and <span
  class="sc">Turkeys</span>, since they are well known to us all. <span
  class="sc">Guinea-fowls</span> are African birds. The farmyard form, popularly known as
  "Come-backs," from their peculiar cry "come-back, come-back, come-back," is a descendant of the
  common helmeted form, of which type there are eight distinct species. Besides these are four
  crested species; one very beautiful species known as the <span class="sc">Vulture-like
  Guinea-fowl</span>; and one, the rarest of all, known as the <span class="sc">Black
  Guinea-fowl</span>. Even in the British Museum, writes Mr. Ogilvie Grant, "there are only two
  examples of it, and neither of these are perfect specimens." It was discovered by M. Du Chaillu.
  "One day," he says, "I went out hunting by myself, and, to my great joy, shot another new bird, a
  black wild-fowl, one of the most singular birds I have seen in Africa.... The head, where it is
  bare, is in the female of a pink hue, and in the male of a bright scarlet.... Wild they are, and
  most difficult to approach, and rare, even in the forests where they are at home." They do not
  travel in huge flocks, like other guinea-fowls, but a male and two females at most.</p>

  <p>The familiar form of the <span class="sc">Turkey</span> scarcely needs description; but most
  people are probably puzzled by its name. Why Turkey? The bird is a native of America, so it
  certainly cannot have anything to do with its place of origin. Professor Newton has it that it is
  on account of its call-note, "to be syllabled 'turk, turk, turk,' whereby it may almost be said to
  have named itself."</p>

  <p>The domesticated turkey is descended from the <span class="sc">Mexican Turkey</span>, and was
  probably introduced into Europe during the sixteenth century. This, according to Captain Bendire,
  is a mountain-living species, and still abundant in the wilder portions of Western Texas and New
  Mexico. It appears to attain greater bulk than its domesticated descendant, Captain Bendire having
  recorded a specimen shot by himself which weighed 28 lbs. after having been drawn, and heavier
  birds are said to occur occasionally.</p>

  <p>The Mexicans say that the coyotes catch turkeys by running in circles under the tree in which
  they are roosting, till the birds get dizzy with watching them, and fall down into the open mouths
  below!</p>

  <p>There are three distinct kinds of turkey&mdash;the <span class="sc">Mexican</span>, <span
  class="sc">American</span>, and <span class="sc">Honduras Turkey</span>. The last is a very fine
  bird, with a bright blue head and neck, instead of red. The top of the head is adorned with
  numerous scarlet, berry-like warts, looking like holly-berries.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Bob-whites</span>, which belong to the group of tooth-billed game-birds
  known as American Partridges and Quails, demand a brief reference here. The species represented in
  the illustration on page <a href="#page399">399</a> is common in the lowlands of Texas. It is a
  very unsuspicious bird, and in consequence falls an easy prey to foxes, hariers, and rattlesnakes,
  the last-named being the worst enemies, as many as five of these unfortunate birds having been
  taken at one time from the stomach of one of these monsters, and on another occasion a female and
  half a dozen of her eggs were similarly discovered.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page411"><span class="smaller">{411}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Megapodes</span> and <span class="sc">Brush-turkeys</span>, though dull
  and uninteresting-looking birds, are, on account of the facts connected with the propagation of
  their species, quite remarkable. They do not brood over their eggs, as do other birds, but instead
  bury them, either in sand in the neighbourhood of warm springs or in heaps of decaying vegetable
  matter. In the latter case the material is often collected by several birds working together.
  Mounds of 8 feet high and 60 feet in circumference have been found, the work of the <span
  class="sc">Nicobar Megapode</span>. Such have been many years in use, material being added each
  season. Into this mass the female digs down and deposits an egg every second day, covering it up
  as soon as laid. There it remains till hatched, when the young, probably aided by its mother,
  forces its way up to the surface, and emerges, <i>not</i> a downy nestling as one would expect,
  but clothed with feathers differing but slightly in texture from those worn in the adult state.
  Owing to the precocious development, young megapodes are able to fly within an hour after
  birth.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <span class="sc">Curassows</span> and <span class="sc">Guans</span> are very
  handsome birds, but probably quite unknown to most of our readers, yet they may always be seen in
  Zoological Gardens. They are closely related to the megapodes, which we have just been discussing;
  but their nesting habits are quite different. They lay their eggs in nests, either on the ground
  or in trees, and brood over them like other birds. Many have brilliantly coloured bare skin on the
  head and handsome crests. They are natives of Central and South America, where they are often kept
  by the settlers, as they tame easily. It is said that one of the guans, when crossed with the
  domesticated fowl, becomes intensely pugnacious, and superior to the game-cock for fighting
  purposes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Bustard-quail and Plain-wanderers.</span></p>

  <p>These are small and quail-like in appearance, though they are probably only distant relatives
  of the Game-birds. But they are, nevertheless, remarkable birds. A great authority, Mr. A. O.
  Hume, writing of the <span class="sc">Indian Bustard-quail</span>, says of them: "The most
  remarkable point in the life-history of these bustard-quails is the extraordinary fashion in
  which, amongst them, the position of the sexes is reversed. The females are the larger and
  handsomer birds. The females only call, the females only fight&mdash;natives say that they fight
  for the males, and probably this is true. The males ... only ... sit upon the eggs, the females
  meanwhile larking about, calling, and fighting, without any care for their obedient mates; and,
  lastly, the males tend ... the young brood."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page412"><span class="smaller">{412}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3">The group has a wide geographical range, occurring in Europe, Africa, Madagascar,
  South Asia, the Indian Archipelago, and Australia.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Hoatzin.</span></p>

  <p>This bird is one of the puzzles of the ornithologist. Its pedigree is still a mystery, but it
  is generally believed to have some relation to the Game-birds. Its whole life is passed in trees
  overhanging water, and its flight restricted to short journeys from tree to tree. In South
  America, its home, it is known by a variety of names, one of which means <span
  class="sc">Stinking-pheasant</span>. This is in allusion to the peculiar odour of its flesh, which
  smells, according to some, like musk, and to others like raw hides. Another remarkable feature of
  this bird is the fact that it has turned its crop into a sort of gizzard, whilst the true gizzard,
  having been relieved of its functions, has diminished to the size of a hazel-nut. The unusual
  purpose to which the crop has been put has brought about considerable modification in the form of
  the breast-bone, which is quite different to that of any other bird.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The young of these birds are quite as remarkable as the parents, for almost as soon
  as they are hatched they crawl out of the nest, along the boughs of the tree in which it rests, to
  meet the parents coming with food. In these crawling excursions they are aided by the wings, which
  for a time serve as fore feet. The thumb and first finger are armed with strong claws, with which
  a firm hold is gained on the bark of the tree. To render these claws effective so long as they are
  necessary, the quill-feathers of the tip of the wing have their development checked till the
  others have grown long enough to serve the purposes of flight.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Rails.</span></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Rails</span> are all water-loving birds, dwelling in swamps or on the
  borders of lakes and streams. Although all swim easily, none have webbed feet. The flight is weak;
  several species, indeed, have lost this power altogether. The body is much compressed, enabling
  them to pass readily through the narrow interspaces of dense aquatic foliage. The Rails appear to
  be related on the one hand to the Game-birds, and on the other to the Cranes. In size they vary
  from a bird as large as a fowl to one as small as a lark.</p>

  <p>One of the commonest of the Rails is the <span class="sc">Corn-crake</span>, more commonly,
  perhaps, known as the <span class="sc">Land-rail</span>. Its curious grating cry is one of the
  commonest sounds which the summer brings with it, and one possessing a charm of its own. But
  rarely seen, it builds its nest in hay-fields, and, when the grass is being cut, sits so closely
  on its treasures that it is sometimes beheaded by the swinging scythe. In the autumn it falls not
  infrequently to the sportsmen when partridge-shooting. The corn-crake leaves in the winter for the
  more congenial climate of Africa, a feat that seems wonderful when its feeble powers of flight are
  considered. Its near relative the <span class="sc">Water-rail</span> is rather a handsome bird,
  but of shy and retiring habits.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Weka-rail</span>, a native of New Zealand, is one of the flightless forms
  to which we <span class="pagenum" id="page413"><span class="smaller">{413}</span></span>have
  referred. It is about as large as a pheasant, but lacks its splendour, being soberly clad in brown
  and black. Unlike its relative, it breeds in a burrow, which it digs for itself by the aid of its
  bill. The name "weka" was given it by the Maoris.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Common Water-hen</span>, or <span class="sc">Moor-hen</span>, is one of
  the most familiar birds of the London parks. Although frequent enough to be seen upon streams and
  broads, it is, nevertheless, shy and wary; but in the sanctuary of the public parks all reserve is
  thrown off. The water-hen, like its allies, is an expert swimmer, in spite of the fact that the
  toes are not webbed; on the contrary, they are very long and slender. When alarmed, these birds
  will often submerge the body till only the beak projects above water.</p>

  <p class="sp3">All the members of this group are easily recognised by the bare patch of skin
  extending from the beak on to the top of the head. In the <span class="sc">Coots</span> this is
  white; in the <span class="sc">Water-hens</span> and <span class="sc">Gallinules</span> it is red.
  The coots and water-hens are clad in sober colours, grey or black; but the gallinules are
  gorgeously clad in purple, shaded with dark green, olive-brown, and black. <span
  class="sc">Mantell's Gallinule</span> of New Zealand is probably now extinct, the last bird having
  been killed in 1898.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Fin-feet.</span></p>

  <p class="sp5">These are little-known birds, found in Africa, South America, South-east Asia, and
  Sumatra. They are closely related to the coots, but differ therefrom in many important
  particulars. Like the coots, they are river-haunting birds, and have broad flaps of skin fringing
  the toes, which serve the purpose of a web; but they have much longer necks and tails than the
  coots and water-hens. Not much is known about them.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>PIGEONS AND SAND-GROUSE.</i></p>

  <p>Pigeons, as a rule, are birds of wonderful powers of flight. The young, which never exceed two
  in number, are hatched perfectly blind and helpless, and but sparsely clothed. They are nourished
  by a peculiar milky secretion of the parents' crop known as "pigeons' milk." The operation of
  feeding is performed by the parent thrusting its beak into the mouth of its offspring and ejecting
  therein the secretion just referred to. The nest is a very simple structure, being composed of
  twigs, generally placed in a tree, but sometimes in a cave or hole in a bank. The eggs, which
  never exceed two in number, are pure white.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most beautiful species occur among the large group known as <span
  class="sc">Fruit-pigeons</span>. Many of these are invested in raiment of vivid green and yellow,
  forming a little coterie by themselves&mdash;the <span class="sc">Green Pigeons</span>. Others, on
  account of their brilliancy, have been designated <span class="sc">Painted Pigeons</span>, of
  which, perhaps, the most beautiful of all is <span class="sc">Eug&egrave;ne's Pigeon</span>. Try to
  imagine it! The head is pure white, the upper part of the breast a purple-red surrounded by a dull
  purple band; the under parts are greyish green, shading into white; the flanks green; whilst the
  upper parts are also green, but of a rich bronze tint. Another group from the Fiji Islands
  includes a magnificent species, the male of which is clothed in a glorious orange, save the head
  and throat, which are olive-yellow. His mate is scarcely less beautiful, her plumage being rich
  green. Another member of the group&mdash;the <span class="sc">White Nutmeg-pigeon</span>&mdash;is
  clad in creamy white, with black quills, and a black tip to the tail. It is a native of Borneo.
  The fruit-pigeons, it should be mentioned, include some of the largest of living pigeons.</p>

      down.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Whilst many of the Pigeon Tribe seem to have succeeded in dyeing their feathers with all the
  hues of the rainbow, others have secured equal glory by a covering which at first sight would
  rather appear to be of burnished metal than of feathers. The most striking instance of this is
  found in the magnificent <span class="sc">Nicobar Pigeons</span>. There are two species of these
  birds, which occur not only in the Nicobar Islands, from which they take their name, but also in
  the Malay Archipelago and the Solomon and Pelew Islands. The general tone of the one species is
  black, but the upper parts are superbly glossed with bronze and copper reflections. The other,
  from the Pelew Islands, is indigo-blue in general tone. In one of the Nicobar Islands these birds
  occur in thousands. Furthermore, these two pigeons stand alone, in that the neck-feathers are
  greatly elongated, forming "hackles" like those of the common fowl.</p>

  <p>The largest of living pigeons are the <span class="sc">Gouras</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Crowned Pigeons</span>. There are six species, all of which are confined to
  Australasia. They are characterised by a huge and very beautiful fan-shaped crest of feathers
  which springs from the crown of the head.</p>

  <p>At the other extreme stand the <span class="sc">Namaqua</span> and <span class="sc">Scaly
  Doves</span>. The former is regarded by Professor Newton as one of the most graceful in form of
  all the Pigeon Tribe: the latter are scarcely, if at all, larger than the sparrows.</p>

  <p>The power of flight of some forms is, however, extremely limited; they bid fair in course of
  time to become flightless, like the dodo and the solitaire. The most interesting of these is the
  <span class="sc">Grey-naped Ground-pigeon</span>. Pigeons for the most part display a marked
  preference for a life among the trees rather than on the ground; but there are some which are
  essentially ground-dwellers. The species in which this changed habit is most deeply rooted, and
  probably of longest standing, exhibit one very interesting point of difference from their
  neighbours of the woods. This difference consists in the very considerably longer legs which mark
  the ground-haunting bird. The <span class="sc">Grey-naped Ground-pigeon</span> of South-east New
  Guinea forms an excellent example, inasmuch as the legs are much longer than in any other pigeon.
  These birds (for there are three species in all) resemble the Megapodes in habit, and frequent
  hills or dense thickets. They lay one egg, which is deposited at the foot of a tree.</p>

  <p>Among domesticated breeds is the <span class="sc">English Pouter</span>, a bird characterised
  by its enormous gullet, which can be distended with air whenever the owner wills. The carriage of
  the body is vertical, not, as in pigeons generally, horizontal. The <span
  class="sc">Carrier</span> is a breed illustrating the result of long-sustained selection to
  increase, amongst other characters, the development of the bare skin surrounding the eye and beak
  of all pigeons, wild or tame. In the <span class="sc">Short-faced Tumbler</span> we have a breed
  wherein those birds with the shortest beaks have been steadily bred from. To-day so little beak is
  left that some individuals are hatched which, when grown up, are unable to feed themselves. An
  example of a radical change in the feathers is the <span class="sc">Indian Frill-back</span>. In
  this case the feathers all over the body are reversed, or turned forwards, giving the bird a quite
  extraordinary appearance. In the <span class="sc">Jacobin</span> we have a breed&mdash;and we
  could cite others&mdash;wherein the feathers of the neck are much elongated, and turn upwards and
  forwards over the head to form a hood.</p>

  <p>In general appearance <span class="sc">Sand-grouse</span> are small, very short-legged birds,
  with small heads and pointed wings and tail. Their general tone of coloration may be described as
  sand-coloured, and this has been adopted to render them in harmony with the barren sand-wastes in
  which they dwell. But some may be described as quite highly coloured, being banded and splashed
  with chestnut, black, pearly grey, white, and yellow, according to the species.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Pallas's Sand-grouse</span> is a native of the Kirghiz Steppes, extending
  through Central Asia to Mongolia and Northern China, and northwards to Lake Baikal, and southwards
  to Turkestan. Here they may be met with in enormous numbers. In North China large numbers are
  often caught after a snow-storm. The snow is cleared away, and a small green bean is scattered
  about. Young sand-grouse differ remarkably in one particular from young pigeons, inasmuch as the
  former are hatched covered with a thick down, and are able to run about soon after leaving the
  egg, whilst the pigeon comes into the world very helpless and much in need of clothing. Three eggs
  are laid by the sand-grouse, and these are double-spotted; whilst the pigeon lays but two, which
  are white. The eggs of the sand-grouse are laid in a depression in the ground, without any
  nest.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="fine">THE AUK TRIBE.</span></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Guillemot</span> is found all around Britain, and breeds wherever the sea
  is fringed by cliffs affording ledges for the reception of the eggs. It breeds in colonies often
  numbering many thousands, and lays but one egg, which is large and pear-shaped. Since the
  guillemot builds no nest, but lays its egg on the bare rock, this peculiar shape is advantageous,
  since it revolves on itself, when disturbed, instead of rolling off the ledge into the sea. At the
  same time thousands of eggs fall into the sea every year owing to the bird's leaving the egg,
  whilst incubating, in too great a hurry. At Lundy Island one of the sources of amusement for the
  gaping tourist was that of firing a shot to frighten the birds, with the result that, at each
  shot, showers of eggs were knocked off the ledges on to the rocks below. The colour of the egg
  varies infinitely, no two being quite alike. This, it has been suggested, is useful, as the mother
  is thereby enabled to identify her own egg, even when surrounded by hundreds of others. The young
  are covered with long down, and when big enough, but still unable to fly, are taken down by the
  mother to the sea, being carried, some say, on her back: others say the chick is seized by the
  wing and carried down.</p>

      <p class="sp0">There are two species of white tern, almost restricted to the Southern
      Hemisphere.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Razor-bill</span> is nearly, if not quite, as common on the coasts of
  Britain as the guillemot, from which it may be readily distinguished by its beak, which is much
  compressed from side to side&mdash;hence its name of Razor-bill&mdash;and deeply grooved. In
  habits it very closely resembles the guillemot, but in one respect at least it is a more
  interesting bird, inasmuch as it is related to and closely resembles the now extinct <span
  class="sc">Great Auk</span>, the giant of the tribe. The smallest British representative, it
  should be mentioned, is the <span class="sc">Little Auk</span>, a species more nearly allied to
  the guillemot. It is only a winter visitant to Britain, breeding in huge colonies on the
  inhospitable shores of Greenland and Iceland.</p>

  <p>So quaint a bird as the <span class="sc">Puffin</span> most certainly finds a place here. One
  of its most characteristic features is its enormous bill, which is rendered more conspicuous on
  account of its bright colour. It is bluish at the base, yellow at the tip, and striped with
  orange. A very remarkable feature of this bill is the fact that it is larger in summer than
  winter, portions of the sheath being shed in autumn.</p>

  <p>Enormous numbers of puffins breed in Ireland; myriads breed on Lundy Island. The Farne Islands,
  the cliffs of Flamborough, and Scotland are also tenanted by thousands. Puffins breed in holes,
  which they dig for themselves when occasion requires, but when rabbit-burrows are to be had they
  prefer these, dispossessing the owners without the slightest compunction. Might, with the puffin,
  is right, as well as with many other animals.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page418"><span class="smaller">{418}</span></span></div>

  <p>Young puffins, like young auks and guillemots, are hatched covered with long down. The parents
  feed them on fish, which they deposit at the mouth of the burrow twenty at a time, and give them
  to the young bird one by one. When the female is sitting, her mate feeds her in a similar way.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Puffins lay only a single egg, which differs from that of its relatives the Auks
  and Guillemots in being white. The white colour enables the sitting-bird to see it in the dark
  burrow.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="fine">THE GULL TRIBE.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">To get at the real inwardness of the Gull Tribe, so to speak, we must examine their
  anatomy very closely; then we shall be convinced that they are modified Plovers, and have nothing
  to do with the Petrels, to which they bear an undoubted resemblance.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Terns.</span></p>

  <p>Terns are gulls in miniature, on which account it is probable that many a visitor to the
  seashore passes them unwittingly. But let him watch next time for what look like flocks of tiny,
  long-winged, and unusually active gulls, now hovering gracefully in the air, and now suddenly
  plunging headlong like an arrow to the sea, with a force and dash that will surprise him, now that
  attention is drawn to them. These are terns. From their vivacity and forked tails, they have been
  aptly named Sea-swallows.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Terns lay their eggs among the shingle; from their coloration, these are
      difficult to detect among the surrounding stones.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There are several species of tern. Like the Gulls, they have a distinctive dress for summer and
  winter, but the sexes are both dressed alike. The general livery, as with the Gulls, is pearly
  grey above and pure white below&mdash;in summer, in some species, relieved by a black head. One
  species, the <span class="sc">Roseate Tern</span>, has the breast suffused with a most exquisite
  rose-pink, which fades rapidly after death, however. Young terns, in their first plumage, differ
  conspicuously from their parents, having much brown intermixed with grey.</p>

  <p>Terns lay about three eggs, which are deposited among the shingle on the beach; and so closely
  do the eggs, and later on the young, resemble the surrounding stones that it is almost impossible
  to find them. As a rule terns breed in colonies, often numbering many thousand birds.</p>

  <p>There are exceptions to the rule just laid down as to nest-building. One species of the <span
  class="sc">Noddy Terns</span>, for example, builds a nest of turf and dry grass, placed in bushes
  or in low trees. It seems to return to the same nest year after year, adding on each return new
  materials, till they form masses nearly 2 feet in height. Occasionally it appears to make a
  mud-nest, placed in the fork of a tree; whilst the superb little <span class="sc">White
  Noddy</span> often deposits <span class="pagenum" id="page419"><span
  class="smaller">{419}</span></span>its egg on the leaf of a cocoanut-palm&mdash;truly a wonderful
  site, and still more wonderful when we reflect that it is chosen by one of the Gull Tribe.</p>

  <p class="sp3">About six species of tern commonly occur in the British Islands, and some five or
  six other species occasionally visit them.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Skimmers</span> are tern-like birds, with a very wide geographical
  distribution, occurring in India, Africa, and North and South America, and remarkable for the very
  extraordinary form of the beak. The upper jaw is much shorter than the lower, and both are
  compressed to the thinness of a knife-blade. This beak is associated with, and is probably an
  adaptation to, an equally remarkable method of feeding, which has been admirably described by
  Darwin, who watched them feeding in a lake near Maldonado.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"They kept their bills," he says, "wide open, and the lower mandible half buried in
  the water. Thus skimming the surface, they ploughed it in their course; ... and it formed a most
  curious spectacle to behold a flock, each bird leaving its narrow wake on the mirror-like surface.
  In their flight ... they dexterously manage with their projecting lower mandible to plough up
  small fish, which are secured by the upper and shorter half of their scissor-like bills."</p>

      <p class="sp3">YOUNG HERRING-GULLS IN THE GREY PHASE OF PLUMAGE.</p>
      <p class="sp0">In their dull grey plumage the young of all gulls are very unlike the
      adults.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Gulls are larger and heavier birds than terns, with longer legs, and shorter, thicker beaks.
  Furthermore, with one exception, the tail is never forked. Like the terns, gulls generally breed
  in colonies, and these are often of large size. Young gulls, when newly hatched, are quite active.
  Later, when their feathers have grown, they are found to wear a dress quite different from that of
  the parents. Sometimes the adult plumage is gained at the end of the first year of existence,
  sometimes not until after the third year. Gulls feed on everything that comes in their way, from
  fish caught swimming at the surface of the sea to worms picked up at the plough-tail.</p>

  <p>One of the commonest and best known of all the gulls is perhaps the species known as the <span
  class="sc">Black-headed Gull</span>, which has become so common in the heart of busy London, where
  hundreds may be seen, during the winter months, flying up and down the river, or <span
  class="pagenum" id="page420"><span class="smaller">{420}</span></span>wheeling about over the
  lakes in the parks. The black-headed gull receives its popular name on account of the fact that,
  like some terns and some other gulls, in the spring, the feathers of the head suddenly acquire a
  sooty-black colour: all trace of this is lost in the winter, save for two patches, one behind each
  ear.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The plumage so closely resembles the sandy soil on which the bird lives that
      concealment is easily effected by crouching close to the ground.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The eggs of this bird are collected in thousands each spring, and sold in London and other
  markets as plovers' eggs. As many as 20,000 have been taken in a season from the extensive gullery
  at Scoulton Mere, in Norfolk.</p>

  <p>Three or four eggs are laid in a nest of rushes, which is always placed on the ground in marshy
  and often inaccessible spots.</p>

  <p>The largest of the Gull Tribe is the <span class="sc">Great Black-backed Gull</span>, which is,
  furthermore, a common British bird; indeed, it is frequently seen flying, together with the
  last-mentioned species, on the Thames, doing its best to get a full share of the tit-bits thrown
  by interested spectators from the various London bridges. Unlike the black-headed gull, it has no
  seasonal change of plumage, but is clad all the year round in the purest white, set off by a
  mantle of bluish black. The young of this bird has a quite distinct plumage of greyish brown, and
  hence has been described as a distinct species&mdash;the <span class="sc">Grey Gull</span>. This
  dress is gradually changed for the adult plumage, but the process takes about three years.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Kittiwake</span> is another of the common British gulls, breeding in
  thousands in favourable localities on the coasts. Its eggs are deposited on the narrowest and most
  inaccessible ledges of precipitous cliffs. This species sometimes falls a victim to the fashion of
  wearing feathers. "At Clovelly," writes Mr. Howard Saunders, "there was a regular staff for
  preparing plumes; and fishing-smacks, with extra boats and crews, used to commence their work of
  destruction at Lundy Island by daybreak on the 1st of August.... In many cases the wings were torn
  off the wounded birds before they were dead, the mangled victims being tossed back into the
  water." And he has seen, he continues, "hundreds of young birds dead or dying of starvation in the
  nests, through the want of their parents' care.... It is well within the mark to say that at least
  9,000 of these inoffensive birds were destroyed during the fortnight."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page421"><span class="smaller">{421}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3">Of the <span class="sc">Skua-gulls</span> there are several species. Their
  coloration differs from that of the gulls just described in being confined to shades of brown. One
  of their most remarkable traits is that of piracy. They await their cousins the Gulls coming
  shoreward from the sea with newly swallowed fish, and then, giving chase, compel the gull, in
  order to lighten itself and escape, to disgorge its hard-won meal. So swift of flight is the skua
  that the ejected morsel is caught before it reaches the water.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="fine">THE PLOVER TRIBE.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Birds</span> of very various size, shape, and coloration are included in this
  group&mdash;that is to say, birds which vary much superficially, but, it must be understood, all
  undoubtedly closely related. In England they are to be met with almost everywhere. The seashore,
  the lonely moorland, the desolate marshes, the river's brink, or the woods&mdash;all these shelter
  some one or other of the Plover Tribe. Like the Gulls, many adopt a distinctive dress for the
  courting-season, which, however, is sometimes worn by the males only, and not by both sexes alike,
  as in the Gulls. One of the most striking and familiar instances of this change is seen in the
  <span class="sc">Grey Plover</span>. In winter the plumage of the upper-parts of this bird is
  dusky grey, that of the under-parts pure white; but in the spring the former is exchanged for a
  beautifully variegated mantle of black and white, and the latter becomes uniformly jet-black, save
  the under tail-coverts, which remain white.</p>

      <p class="sp3">OYSTER-CATCHER ON ITS NEST.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Three eggs are laid in a slight hollow in the ground. The oyster-catcher is one
      of the most wary of the Plover Tribe, and very difficult to approach.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the <span class="sc">Dunlin</span>, again, we have a similar change, the upper-parts being
  in winter grey, the under-parts white: in the spring the former become black, with an admixture of
  rust-colour, and the latter black in so far as the breast is concerned, but the abdomen remains
  white.</p>

  <p>In many of that section of the Plover Tribe distinguished as "Wading-birds," the changes which
  take place in the spring in the plumage of the upper-parts resemble those already instanced, but
  the under-parts turn to a rich chestnut instead of black. This occurs in the forms known as the
  <span class="sc">Godwits</span>, <span class="sc">Knots</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Sanderlings</span>, for example.</p>

  <p>In all the instances so far quoted, both male and female are coloured alike, but, as already
  hinted, occasionally the change of plumage affects the male only. This is the case with the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page422"><span class="smaller">{422}</span></span><span
  class="sc">Ruff</span>. The importance of this exception is still further increased by the fact
  that the change in coloration is accompanied by the development of a large frill around the neck,
  surmounted by two large tufts called "ears," and fleshy, brightly coloured warts around the beak.
  The coloured picture of the male in its spring dress, which will be found on another page, gives
  an admirable idea of the typical ruff, but it must necessarily fail to give any indication of one
  very remarkable fact concerning this frill and the two "ears," and for this reason&mdash;no two
  individuals ever have these peculiar feathers of the same coloration and pattern. The range of
  colour is certainly not great&mdash;the changes being rung, so to speak, on black, white,
  chestnut, bay, and ash-colour. Diversification is gained by contrasting the "ears" with the frill,
  and adding bars or streaks to the light coloration, and purple, green, and violet reflections to
  the dark. These ornaments are donned in a surprisingly short space of time, and are discarded as
  quickly, for they are scarcely completed by the month of May, and are thrown off again at the end
  of June. During the time that this resplendent livery is worn the males engage in mimic
  battles&mdash;which may occasionally develop into real ones&mdash;arranged apparently for the
  edification of the females, which, it seems, select as partners, at least for that season, those
  which please or excite most. This power of pleasing must certainly be considerable, for the ruff
  is a polygamous species.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Formerly the ruff was a common bird in England, but the drainage of the fens and persecution
  have practically brought about its extermination.</p>

  <p>At least two groups of plovers have succeeded in reversing the usual order of things in the
  matter of sexual plumage. These are the <span class="sc">Phalaropes</span>&mdash;which are British
  birds&mdash;and the <span class="sc">Painted Snipe</span>, in both of which the female is more
  brightly coloured and somewhat larger in size than the <span class="pagenum" id="page423"><span
  class="smaller">{423}</span></span>male. As is the case where this reversal occurs, the duties of
  incubation fall mainly or entirely upon the smaller and duller male. It is interesting to note,
  furthermore, that only in the phalaropes is there a seasonal change of plumage: in the painted
  snipe the same livery is worn all the year round.</p>

  <p>Many of the plovers have no seasonal change of plumage, but both male and female wear all the
  year round, some a more or less markedly bright-coloured livery, as the <span
  class="sc">Dotterel</span> and <span class="sc">Turnstones</span>, others a more sober vestment,
  as the <span class="sc">Curlews</span> and <span class="sc">Snipe</span>, for example.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Snipe</span> and <span class="sc">Woodcock</span> may be cited as
  especially instructive forms in this connection, showing, in regard to the beak, for instance,
  undoubted proof of this structural modification, the result of adaptation to the peculiar method
  of seeking their food. This beak constitutes an organ of touch of great sensitiveness, and is used
  as a probe, to thrust down into the soft soil in the search for hidden worms.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Bustards have very short toes, like many other birds which walk much on sandy
      soil.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of the three species of snipe which occur in Britain, probably the one known as the <span
  class="sc">Common Snipe</span> is most familiar; but it will, perhaps, be new to some to learn
  that this bird ranks as a musical performer, on account of a very extraordinary "bleating" or
  "drumming" noise which it gives forth, especially during the spring of the year&mdash;the season
  of courtship. We cannot describe this noise better, perhaps, than as an unusually high-pitched
  "hum," produced, it is generally held, by wind driven between the outer tail-feathers by the rapid
  vibration of the wings as the bird descends, or rather pitches, at a fearful pace, earthwards.
  These feathers have the shafts peculiarly thickened; and it is interesting to note that the
  characteristic sound may be artificially produced if they be fastened to a stick and rapidly
  whirled through the air.</p>

  <p>The snipe and woodcock are not the only members of the Plover Tribe whose beaks have undergone
  marked structural modifications; indeed, many instances could be cited, but two or three must
  suffice. In the <span class="sc">Avocet</span> the beak turns upwards like an awl, and the bird is
  in consequence known in some places as the <span class="sc">Cobbler's-awl Duck</span>. In one
  particular, however, the beak differs from an awl, tapering as it does to an exceedingly fine
  point. When the <span class="pagenum" id="page424"><span class="smaller">{424}</span></span>bird
  feeds, it walks along in shallow water with the curved tip of the beak resting on the surface and
  the head moving swiftly from side to side, the jaws meanwhile being opened and closed with
  exceeding rapidity, and seizing instantly upon such small crustacea and other organisms as come in
  their way.</p>

  <p>Although all the Plovers might be described as long-legged birds, the <span
  class="sc">Stilts</span> are quite exceptionally so, and afford evidence of modification in
  another direction. Relatively to the size of the body, the stilts have the longest legs of all
  living birds. They seek their prey by wading in shallow water, like the Avocets, to which they are
  closely related. One species&mdash;the <span class="sc">Black-winged
  Stilt</span>&mdash;occasionally appears in Britain.</p>

  <p>Some other members of the Plover Tribe&mdash;the <span class="sc">Jacana</span> of Brazil, and
  the <span class="sc">Water-pheasant</span> of India, Ceylon, and China, for example&mdash;have
  enormously long toes, as well as claws of great length.</p>

  <p>The Plover Tribe, Bustards, Cranes, and Rails form a large group of diverse but probably
  closely related forms.</p>

  <p>Of the Bustards, the most interesting and important species is the <span class="sc">Great
  Bustard</span>. About a hundred years ago this magnificent bird might have been seen any day in
  such favoured localities as the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire wolds, the Norfolk and Suffolk
  "brecks," the heaths of Newmarket, or the downs of Berkshire and Wiltshire. It owes its
  extermination to several causes, foremost among which must be reckoned the reclaiming of waste
  land and improved methods of agriculture. "The bulk of its body," says Professor Newton, "renders
  it a conspicuous and stately object; and when on the wing, to which it readily takes, its flight
  is not inferior in majesty to that of the eagle." The expanse of the outstretched wings of a great
  bustard is 8 feet, or even more; and the weight of the male may even exceed 35 lbs. The female is
  smaller.</p>

  <p class="sp3">To see the great bustard in a wild state to-day, one would have to travel to Spain.
  And if one could make a pilgrimage for this purpose during the birds' courting-season, some very
  wonderful antics on the part of the male would be witnessed. These antics make up what is really a
  very elaborate love-display. In this performance the bird inflates his neck with wind, draws his
  head closely down on to the back, throws up his tail, so as to make the most of the pure white
  feathers underneath, and sticks up certain of the quill-feathers of the wing in a manner that only
  a great bustard can. Certain long feathers projecting from each side of the head now stand out
  like the quills of the porcupine, forming a sort of <i>cheval-de-frise</i> on either side of the
  head, and complete the picture, which, in our eyes, savours of the ludicrous. The inflation of the
  neck is brought about by filling a specially developed wind-bag between the gullet and the skin
  with air through a small hole under the tongue. For many years it was believed this bag was used
  as a sort of water-bottle, to enable the bird to live amid the arid wastes which were its chosen
  haunts. We now know what its real use is. Visitors to the Natural History Museum in London will
  find, beautifully mounted, a male bustard "in the act of showing off," as it is called, and hard
  by a dissection of the head and neck, showing this wonderful wind-bag.</p>

  <p>One of the most beautiful of this group of peculiarly handsome birds was once numbered among
  British birds; now, alas! like the bustard, it is one of the rarest visitors. Till the end of the
  sixteenth century the <span class="sc">Common Crane</span> reared its young in the fen-lands. In
  Saxon times we read of a request being made by King Ethelbert to Boniface, Bishop of Mayence,
  begging him to send over two falcons suitable for flying at the cranes in Kent. In one case, at a
  feast given by Archbishop Neville in the reign of Edward IV., as many as <span class="pagenum"
  id="page427"><span class="smaller">{427}</span></span>204 cranes figured in the menu. Later, it is
  interesting to note, they seem to have fallen somewhat into disfavour, since we read of a Dr.
  Muffet, of Wiltshire, somewhere about 1570, declaring cranes to be "distinctly unfit for sound
  men's tables.... Yet being young, killed with a goshawk, and hanged two or three days by the
  heels, eaten with hot gelentine, and drowned in sack, it is permitted unto indifferent
  stomachs."</p>

  <p>The nest is placed on the ground, and contains from two to three eggs. The young are covered
  with down, and, like plovers and bustards, run as soon as hatched.</p>

  <p>The cranes, like many other birds, notably some of the Plover Tribe, occasionally indulge in
  spirited outbursts of dancing. Mr. Nelson, writing of the birds of Alaska, tells how one day he
  was watching two cranes enjoying themselves in this manner. The male suddenly "wheeled his back
  towards the female and made a low bow, his head nearly touching the ground, and ending by a quick
  leap into the air. Another pirouette brought him facing his charmer, whom he greeted with a still
  deeper bow, his wings meanwhile hanging loosely by his side. She replied by an answering bow and
  hop, and then each tried to outdo the other in a series of spasmodic hops and starts, mixed with a
  set of comically grave and ceremonious bows."</p>

  <p>Cranes vary much in general appearance. Some species have much of the skin round the head bare
  and brilliantly coloured, such as the <span class="sc">Sarus Crane</span> of India and the <span

  <p>The <span class="sc">White</span> and <span class="sc">Whooping Cranes</span> are birds of
  wondrous beauty. The first-named species has been not inaptly called the "lily of birds." The
  whole plumage, with the exception of the black quills, is white. The legs are red, as is also the
  face. Dr. Coues, an American ornithologist of great repute, relates how he once mistook one of
  these birds&mdash;the <span class="sc">Whooping-crane</span>&mdash;for an antelope. He and a
  companion saw what they "took to be an antelope standing quietly feeding, with his broad white
  stern toward us, and only about 500 yards off. We attempted for at least fifteen minutes to 'flag'
  the creature up to us, waving a handkerchief on a ramrod.... This proving unavailing, my friend
  proceeded to stalk the game, and crawled on his belly for about half the distance before <span
  class="pagenum" id="page428"><span class="smaller">{428}</span></span>the 'antelope' unfolded his
  broad black-tipped wings and flapped off, revealed at length as a whooping (white) crane."</p>

  <p>The Grebes and Divers are representatives of an exceedingly ancient type, and are in many ways
  besides very interesting. Both are common British birds. The greater part of their lives is spent
  upon the water, and to suit this aquatic existence their bodies are specially modified. One of the
  principal features of this modification is seen in the position of the legs. These, by a
  shortening of the thigh-bones in the grebes, leave the body so far back that when the bird walks
  the body is held vertically. With the divers walking has become an impossibility, and they can
  only move on land on their bellies, pushing themselves along with the feet. Both grebes and divers
  are expert swimmers, and dive with the greatest ease, remaining long under water. The grebes haunt
  ponds, lakes, and broads; the divers prefer the open sea. Both feed on fish.</p>

  be worn by the gentler sex in the form of muffs or hats. Thus a price was set upon the head of
  this beautiful and harmless bird, and its ranks were speedily thinned. Some species wear during

      <p class="sp0">This bird, also known as the Cape or Jackass-penguin, breeds in burrows or
      under ledges of rock.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Penguins</span> may justly be called wonderful birds, and they are
  undoubtedly of very ancient descent. For countless generations the sea has been their home and
  refuge, and, in consequence, flight has been abandoned in exchange for increased swimming-powers,
  which have been gained by transforming the wing into a paddle. This transformation has resulted in
  flattening the wing-bones&mdash;and so increasing the surface of the hand and arm whilst reducing
  its thickness&mdash;and the suppression of the quill-feathers. The result is a blade-like paddle
  closely resembling the paddle of the whale, the turtle, or the extinct fish-lizards. With this
  organ they cleave their way through the water, often far below the surface, in pursuit of food,
  just as of old their ancestors did through the air. In other diving-birds the wings are kept
  closely pressed to the side of the body when under water, whilst the locomotion is effected by the
  feet. The penguin's legs, in consequence of diminished use, have shortened considerably. But
  besides the wings and legs, the feathery covering has also undergone a certain amount of change.
  This has been effected by increasing the size of the shaft of the feather and diminishing the
  vane; as a result, on the front part of the wings these feathers look more like scales than
  feathers.</p>

  <p>Professor Moseley has vividly described the appearance of a flock of penguins at sea. He writes
  from Tristan d'Acunha: "As we approached the shore, I was astonished at seeing a <span
  class="pagenum" id="page431"><span class="smaller">{431}</span></span>shoal of what looked like
  extremely active, very small porpoises or dolphins.... They showed black above and white beneath,
  and came along in a shoal of fifty or more..towards the shore at a rapid pace, by a series of
  successive leaps out of the water and leaps into it again ... Splash, splash, went this marvellous
  shoal of animals, till they went splash through the surf on to the black, stony beach, and then
  struggled and jumped up amongst the boulders and revealed themselves as wet and dripping
  penguins."</p>

  <p>Like their relatives in other parts of the world, penguins breed in huge communities known as
  "rookeries," a rookery being peopled by tens of thousands. Their nests, made of small stones, are
  placed among the tall grass and reached by beaten pathways, exceedingly difficult to walk through.
  Professor Moseley thus describes a "rookery": "At first you try to avoid the nests, but soon find
  that impossible; then, maddened almost by the pain [for they bite furiously at the legs], stench,
  and noise, you have recourse to brutality. Thump, thump, goes your stick, and at each blow down
  goes a bird. Thud, thud, you hear from the men behind you as they kick the birds right and left
  off the nests; and so you go for a bit&mdash;thump, smash, whack, thud, 'caa, caa, urr, urr,' and
  the path behind you is strewn with the dead and dying and bleeding. Of course, it is horribly
  cruel thus to kill whole families of innocent birds, but it is absolutely necessary. One must
  cross the rookeries in order to explore the island at all, and collect the plants, or survey the
  coasts from the heights."</p>

  <p>Penguins feed principally on crustacea, molluscs ("shell-fish"), and small fish, varied with a
  little vegetable matter. Although the legs are very short, penguins yet walk with ease, and can,
  on occasion, run with considerable speed. It would appear, however, as if the largest of the
  tribe, the <span class="sc">Emperor-penguin</span>, had become somewhat too bulky to run; for when
  speed is necessary it lies down upon the snow and propels itself with its feet, travelling, it is
  said, in this manner with incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Penguins, though confined to the Southern Hemisphere, enjoy a wide range and every variety of
  climate. They are found on the Antarctic ice, on the shores of South Africa, South America,
  Australia, New Zealand, and inhabit many islands of the southern seas, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page432"><span class="smaller">{432}</span></span>notably the Falklands, Kerguelen, and
  Tristan d'Acunha. In size penguins vary greatly. The largest is the <span
  class="sc">Emperor-penguin</span> of the Antarctic seas; scarcely smaller is the <span
  class="sc">King-penguin</span> of Kerguelen Island. The emperor-penguin stands some 3&frac12; feet high,
  and may weigh as much as 78 lbs. The <span class="sc">Gentle Penguin</span>, or "Johnny" of the
  sailors, is next in size, being but little smaller than the king-penguin; this species inhabits
  Kerguelen Island and the Falklands. The <span class="sc">Crested Penguins</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Rock-hoppers</span>, of which there are several species, are much smaller; they occur
  in the Falkland Islands, New Zealand, and the Antarctic. The South African form is known as the
  <span class="sc">Black-footed Penguin</span>. Its nearest allies are <span class="sc">Humboldt's
  Penguin</span> of Western South America, and the <span class="sc">Jackass-penguin</span> of the
  Falklands. The smallest of all is the little <span class="sc">Blue Penguin</span> of South
  Australia and New Zealand, standing only 17 inches high.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="fine">THE TUBE-NOSED BIRDS.</span></p>

  <p>Until recently these birds were believed to be closely related to the Gulls, but it is now
  generally agreed that they are really distant relatives of the Divers and Penguins. The
  association with the Gulls was pardonable, for they certainly bear a superficial resemblance to
  them. The birds now under discussion may be readily distinguished from the Gulls by the fact that
  the nostrils open into a tube on the top of the beak, or a pair of tubes, one on either
  side&mdash;hence the name of the group. Like the Gulls, they are sea-birds and web-footed. Their
  young are downy and for a time helpless. One egg is laid, which is white, and in some cases
  spotted with red at the large end. As a rule no nest is made, but the egg laid on the bare ground,
  in a hole or burrow or in crevices of rocks. The Albatrosses build a nest of earth, tufts of
  grass, and moss, the whole structure raising the sitting-bird well above the ground. The Giant and
  Fulmar Petrels also build nests. The albatross is said by Professor Moseley to hold the egg in a
  pouch while sitting, as in the case of the king-penguin. The nature of this pouch has never been
  described.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Although occurring in the seas of all parts of the world, the Southern Hemisphere
  must be regarded as their headquarters, since here the greatest number of species are found. All
  are carnivorous, and&mdash;with the exception of one small group, the Diving-petrels of the Strait
  of Magellan&mdash;are birds of powerful flight. A large number of species belong to this group,
  but an enumeration of all would be wearisome. A few of the more striking have, therefore, been
  selected for description.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Albatrosses.</span></p>

  <p>It was an albatross which brought such woe upon the ancient mariner whose pitiful story is so
  feelingly told by Coleridge. But the tables are occasionally turned, for men falling overboard in
  southern seas are liable to be attacked by these powerful giants. The albatross is mostly renowned
  for its majestic flight. Mr. Froude has given us a wonderful description <span class="pagenum"
  id="page433"><span class="smaller">{433}</span></span>of this flight, which is quoted with
  approval by Professor Newton. It runs as follows: "The albatross wheels in circles round and
  round, and for ever round the ship&mdash;now far behind, now sweeping past in a long, rapid curve,
  like a perfect skater on an untouched field of ice. There is no effort; watch as closely as you
  will, you rarely or never see a stroke of the mighty pinion. The flight is generally near the
  water, often close to it. You lose sight of the bird as he disappears in the hollow between the
  waves, and catch him again as he rises over the crest; but how he rises and whence comes the
  propelling force is to the eye inexplicable: he alters merely the angle at which the wings are
  inclined; usually they are parallel to the water and horizontal; but when he turns to ascend or
  makes a change in his direction, the wings then point at an angle, one to the sky, the other to
  the water."</p>

  <p>Professor Hutton, speaking with similar enthusiasm of the wonderful flight, gives us, however,
  another side to the picture. "Suddenly," he says, "he sees something floating on the water, and
  prepares to alight; but how changed he now is from the noble bird but a moment before, all grace
  and symmetry! He raises his wings, his head goes back, and his back goes in; down drop two
  enormous webbed feet, straddled out to their full extent; and with a hoarse croak, between the cry
  of a raven and that of a sheep, he falls 'souse' into the water. Here he is at home again,
  breasting the waves like a cork. Presently he stretches out his neck, and with great exertion of
  his wings runs along the top of the water for seventy or eighty yards, until, at last, having got
  sufficient impetus, he tucks up his legs, and is once more fairly launched in the air."</p>

  </div>

  <p>When an albatross makes love, Professor Moseley tells us, he stands "by the female on the nest,
  raises his wings, spreads his tail and elevates it, throws up his head with the bill in the air,
  or stretches it straight out forwards as far as he can, and then utters a curious cry.... Whilst
  uttering the cry the bird sways his neck up and down. The female responds with a similar note, and
  they bring the tips of their bills lovingly together. This sort of thing goes on for half an hour
  or so at a time."</p>

  <p>There are several different kinds of albatross. The largest measures over 11 feet across the
  out stretched wings. They are inhabitants of the southern seas.</p>

  <p>After the Albatrosses, the largest bird of the group is the <span class="sc">Giant
  Petrel</span>. The sailors call it "Break-bones," "Nelly," or "Stinker." In habits it differs much
  from its aristocratic relative the albatross, haunting the coasts in search of dead seals and
  whales, and the bodies of other birds. Professor Moseley aptly likens it to the vulture: "It soars
  all day along the coast on the look-out for food. No sooner is an animal killed than numbers
  appear as if by magic, and the birds are evidently well acquainted with the usual proceedings of
  sealers, who kill the sea-elephant, take off the skin and blubber, and leave the carcase. The
  birds gorge themselves with food, just like the vultures, and are then unable to fly. I came
  across half a dozen at Christmas Harbour in this condition. We landed just opposite them; they
  began to run to get out of the way. The men chased them; they ran off, spreading their wings, but
  unable to rise. Some struggled <span class="pagenum" id="page435"><span
  class="smaller">{435}</span></span>into the water and swam away, but two went running on,
  gradually disgorging their food, in the utmost hurry, until they were able to rise, when they made
  off to sea."</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Fulmar Petrel</span> is a British bird. On St. Kilda, Professor Newton
  tells us, from 18,000 to 20,000 young are killed in one week in August, the only time when, by the
  custom of the community, they are allowed to be taken. These, after the oil is extracted, serve
  the islanders for winter food.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Storm-petrel</span> is a small bird which breeds abundantly in St. Kilda
  and the Orkneys, and so fearless that it will allow itself to be taken from the nest by hand.
  Immediately this is done, the bird vomits a quantity of pure oil from its mouth. The wild-fowlers
  make use of this habit, capturing the bird, collecting the oil, and setting the prisoner free
  again. A story is related of a storm-petrel which was kept in a cage for three weeks. It was fed
  by smearing its breast with oil, which the bird swallowed by drawing the feathers separately
  through its beak. These birds are popularly supposed to be seen only before stormy weather, and
  therefore are not welcomed by sailors, who call them "Devil's Birds" and "Witches." This bird
  seems to commend itself to some palates; thus the late Mr. Seebohm says: "Cooked on toast, like
  snipe, we found them delicious eating, very rich, but not at all fishy."</p>

  <p class="sp5">We cannot refrain from a brief mention of the remarkable little <span
  class="sc">Diving-petrel</span>&mdash;remarkable because of its unlikeness to all the other
  Petrels and its strong resemblance to the Auks. But its tubular nostrils and certain anatomical
  characters proclaim its true affinities. "This is a petrel," says Professor Moseley, "that has
  given up the active aerial habits of its allies, and has taken to diving, and has become specially
  modified by natural selection to suit it for this changed habit, though still a petrel in
  essential structure." On two occasions Professor Moseley met with them in the Strait of Magellan,
  and describes the water as being covered with these birds in flocks extending over acres, which
  were made black with them.</p>

  <p>There are few birds which have figured more prominently in the realms of fairy-tale and fable
  than the <span class="sc">White Stork</span>. Today it is almost universally held in affectionate
  regard, and in Holland, Denmark, and Germany is afforded the strictest protection, every effort
  being made, in localities where it is plentiful, to induce it to build its nest upon the
  house-roof. Sometimes, to effect this, its fondness for a stage of some sort being known, a
  cart-wheel is set up, and this generally proves successful, the grateful bird erecting thereon its
  nest. Once occupied, it may be held by several generations of tenants; and year by year additions
  are made to the nest, so that the original shallow structure at last attains a height of several
  feet. The material used in its <span class="pagenum" id="page436"><span
  class="smaller">{436}</span></span>construction consists of sticks and other substances. He
  considers himself a fortunate man indeed who can boast a stork's nest on his house.</p>

  <p>To show how widespread is the regard in which this bird is held, we may mention that in
  Morocco, according to Colonel Irby, "almost every Moorish hovel has its stork's nest on the top, a
  pile of sticks lined with grass and palmetto-fibre," and he goes on to relate that in "Morocco and
  Fez, and some other large towns in the Moorish Empire, there is a regular storks' hospital, and
  that, should one be in any way injured or fall from the nest, it is sent to this institution, or
  rather enclosure, which is kept up by subscriptions from wealthy Moors, who regard the stork as a
  sacred bird."</p>

  <p>Though the nest appears to be generally placed upon buildings, it is, when these fail, built in
  trees, and the selection of such sites must be regarded as representing the original practice of
  the species.</p>

  <p>The stork is one of the very few birds which appear to be quite dumb. It supplies the want of a
  voice by a very remarkable clapping noise made by the long, horny beak. But even this noise is
  rarely made, and appears to be prompted by unusual excitement. "During the breeding-season," Mr.
  Howard Saunders tells us, "storks keep up a clappering with their bills, and this sound may
  frequently be heard proceeding from a number of birds circling in the air at such a height as to
  be almost invisible."</p>

  <p>The affection displayed by storks for their young is proverbial. They feed them by thrusting
  their beaks down into the gaping little mouths, and injecting the half-digested remains of their
  last meal, which may represent reptile, frog, or fish, varied by a small mammal, young bird,
  worms, or insects.</p>

  <p>The white stork is a really beautiful bird. Except the quill- and some of the smaller
  wing-feathers, which are black, the plumage is snow-white, whilst the bill and the legs are bright
  red. Like the swallow, it performs extensive migrations, travelling in flocks, numbering many
  thousands, at an immense height.</p>

  <p>Scarcely less beautiful is the <span class="sc">Black Stork</span>, and, like its
  white-plumaged ally, it is also an occasional visitant to Britain. It is a handsome bird, having
  the plumage of the upper-parts black, richly glossed with purple, copper, and green; the
  under-parts pure white; and the legs and beak red. But it is far less sociable, and consequently
  less known, than the white stork, shunning the haunts of men, and seeking seclusion for its nest
  in the lofty trees of large forests.</p>

  <p>The largest members of the Stork Tribe are the <span class="sc">Adjutant-storks</span> and
  <span class="sc">Jabirus</span>. The adjutants are also, to our eyes at least, singularly ugly
  birds. In spite of this very natural disadvantage, they have won a very high place in the regard
  of the people among whom they dwell, on account of the fact that, both in Africa and India, they
  perform, with the vultures, the work of scavengers. Yet there is something of quaintness about
  these birds, if they are watched from a distance too great to reveal the character which imparts
  the ugliness to which we have referred, and their actions not seldom border on the grotesque. The
  name Adjutant has been bestowed upon them on account of the peculiar gait, which bears a fanciful
  resemblance to the measured pacing of an officer on parade. Like all the Storks, they have large
  bodies and very long legs, but they have outstripped all their relatives in the enormous size of
  the beak. The features which have earned this unenviable reputation for ugliness are the
  peculiarly unkempt and unwashed appearance of the head and neck. These are but scantily clothed in
  very shabby, brown-looking down-feathers; and the neck is made still more, we might almost say,
  repulsive by the presence of a large bare pouch, which can be distended with air to an enormous
  size at will. The Arabs, on account of this pouch, call the species resident with them "The Father
  of the Leather Bottle." Some, however, say that the correct translation of the native name would
  be "The Father of the Beak." But it is not only on account of their scavenging propensities that
  the adjutants are esteemed, for it is from the under tail-coverts of these birds that the
  much-prized "marabou" or "comercolly" feathers are obtained&mdash;at least the finest kinds; for
  some appear to be furnished by that chief of scavengers, the vulture. More precious still "is the
  celebrated stone called Zahir mora, or poison-killer, of great virtue and repute as an antidote to
  all kinds of poison," to be procured only by splitting open the head of the bird before death.
  Needless to say, the existence of this stone lives only in popular superstition, though how many
  poor birds have fallen victims thereto is not pleasant to contemplate.</p>

  <p>Adjutants choose almost inaccessible pinnacles of rock on <span class="pagenum"

  sometimes nest in trees. From two to four white eggs are laid, from which, if all goes well, as
  many young, covered with fluffy white down, are hatched.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Jabirus</span> are distant relatives of, and scarcely inferior in size to,
  the Adjutants. There are three species, one occurring in the Indian Peninsula, New Guinea, and
  Australia, one in Africa, and one in South America. It is to this last species that the name
  Jabiru correctly applies. Furthermore, there can be no doubt that it is one of the handsomest of
  its tribe. The whole plumage is pure white, and the upper-parts are made additionally resplendent
  by an indescribable satin-like gloss. The beautiful whiteness of its plumage is enhanced by the
  fact that the head and neck, bill and feet, are jet-black. Some would give the palm of beauty to
  the <span class="sc">African Saddle-billed Stork</span>. Black and white, as in the American form,
  are the contrasting "colours"; but the plumage of the body, instead of being pure white, is
  plentifully enriched with black, with beautiful purple reflections.</p>

  <p>More or less nearly allied to the Storks are several species familiar enough to the
  professional ornithologist, but not very well known generally. One of the rarest and most
  interesting of these is the <span class="sc">Whale-headed</span> or <span class="sc">Shoe-billed
  Stork</span> of the Nile, remarkable for its enormous boat-shaped bill. More common but equally
  interesting are the beautiful <span class="sc">Flamingoes</span>. Apart from the brilliancy of
  their colour, the most noticeable feature of these birds is the curious beak, which is bent
  downwards at a sharp angle, and provided on its inside with horny plates resembling those of the
  Ducks and Swans. The tongue of this bird, unlike that of the Stork Tribe generally, is thick and
  fleshy, and also resembles that of the duck.</p>

  <p>The flamingo is the only member of the Stork Tribe which builds a mud-nest. Its foundation laid
  often in as much as 15 inches of water, and rising above the surface from 6 to 8 inches, with a
  diameter at the top of 15 inches, it forms a pile of no mean size. Strangely enough, though these
  birds are never so happy as when wading "knee" deep in water, yet after the construction of the
  nest the incubation of the eggs is delayed so long <span class="pagenum" id="page440"><span
  class="smaller">{440}</span></span>that before they are hatched the water has disappeared, leaving
  a burning plain of sun-baked mud. On the top of this nest the parent sits with its long neck
  neatly curled away among the back-feathers, with its long legs doubled up, and projecting behind
  her for some distance beyond the tail. Until quite recently it was believed that the bird
  incubated its eggs by sitting <i>astride</i> the nest, the length of the legs forbidding any other
  position: this has now been proved beyond cavil to be an entirely erroneous opinion.</p>

  <p>The huge flocks in which these birds consort are graphically described by Mr. Abel Chapman as
  follows: "In herds of 300 to 400, several of which are often in sight at once, they stand feeding
  in the open water, all their heads under, greedily tearing up the grasses and water-plants from
  the bottom. On approaching them, which can only be done by extreme caution, their silence is first
  broken by the sentries, who commence walking away with low croaks; then hundreds of necks rise at
  once to full extent, every bird gaggling its loudest, as they walk obliquely away, looking back
  over their shoulders, as though to take stock of the extent of the danger. Pushing a few yards
  forward, up they all rise, and a more beautiful sight cannot be imagined than the simultaneous
  spreading of the crimson wings, flashing against the sky like a gleam of rosy light. In many
  respects these birds bear a strong resemblance to geese. Like them, flamingoes feed by day; and
  great quantities <span class="pagenum" id="page441"><span class="smaller">{441}</span></span>of
  grass, etc., are always floating about the muddy water when a herd has been feeding. Their cry is
  almost indistinguishable from the gaggling of geese, and they fly in the same catenarian
  formations."</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Spoonbills</span> and <span class="sc">Ibises</span> also belong to the
  Stork Tribe. The former are remarkable chiefly for the strange spoon-shaped bill: one species, a
  few hundred years ago, nested in England. This remarkable beak is associated with a peculiar
  method of feeding, well described by the late Mr. Wolley. During the operation, he says, "the beak
  was passed sideways through the water, and kept open till something palatable came within its
  grasp; but the action by which the bird effected this was most singular; for instead of turning
  only its head and neck, it turned its whole body from left to right and from right to left, like
  the balance-wheel of a watch; its neck stretched out and its beak immersed perpendicularly to
  about half its depth: this semicircular action was kept up with great vigour and at a tolerably
  quick march."</p>

  <p>A graphic description by Mr. Alfred Crowley of a visit to the breeding-haunts of the spoonbill,
  about fifteen miles from Amsterdam, in 1884, is well worth reproducing here: "Taking a small boat
  in tow, we were punted across the open water, over which were flying numbers of sand-martins,
  swifts, common and black terns, and black-headed gulls, the reeds being full of coots, moorhens,
  sedge- and reed-warblers, etc., and in the distance we saw, rising above the reeds occasionally, a
  small spoonbill or purple heron. On nearing a large mass of reeds, one of the boatmen struck the
  side of the punt with the pole, when up rose some fifty spoonbills and eight or ten purple herons;
  and as we came closer to the reeds there were soon hovering over our heads, within easy shot, some
  200 of the former, and fifty or sixty of the latter. Strange to say, not a note or sound escaped
  from the spoonbills, and only a few croaks from the herons. On reaching the reeds, we moored our
  punt, and two of the men, wading in the mud, took us in the small boat about fifty yards through
  the reeds, where we found ourselves surrounded by spoonbills' nests. They were placed on the mud
  among the reeds, built about 1 foot or 18 inches high and 2 feet in diameter at the bottom,
  tapering to 1 foot at the top, where there was a slight depression, in which lay four eggs, or in
  most cases four young birds, many ready to leave the nest, and several ran off as we <span
  class="pagenum" id="page442"><span class="smaller">{442}</span></span>approached. In the nests
  with young there was a great difference in age and size, one being about a day or so old, and the
  oldest nearly ready to leave the nest&mdash;some two or three weeks old&mdash;so that evidently
  the birds lay their four eggs at considerable intervals, and begin to sit on depositing the first.
  After wandering about, a matter of difficulty on account of the mud, we found a clutch of only
  three eggs, and one of four, which I managed to blow. We also obtained two clutches of eggs of the
  purple heron, but some of the latter had young."</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Ibises</span>, though much alike in form, are strangely diverse in colour.
  One species was sacred to the ancient Egyptians. The reverence and affection they showed to this
  bird, above all others, is probably largely due to its migrating habits, which obtained in that
  far past just as they do to-day. The naturalist Brehm says on this subject: "When the Nile, after
  being at its lowest ebb, rose again, and the water assumed a red tinge, then the ibis appeared in
  the land of the Pharaohs as a sure guarantee that the stream&mdash;the giver and preserver of
  life, which the people in their profound reverence raised to the rank of a god&mdash;would once
  again empty the well-spring of plenty over the thirsty land. The servant and messenger of an
  all-bounteous Deity commanded of a necessity a reverence of a poetic and distinguished character,
  by reason of its importance: he too must be a god."</p>

  <p>Another species, the <span class="sc">Glossy Ibis</span>, occurs sometimes in Britain. Perhaps
  the most beautiful of all is the <span class="sc">Scarlet Ibis</span> of America, numbers of which
  can be seen in the Zoological Gardens of London. On account of the curved, sickle-shaped bill the
  Ibises were at one time believed to be related to the Curlews: this, however, is now known to be
  quite incorrect.</p>

  <p>It was at one time believed that "the ibis [was] adopted as a part of the arms of the town of
  Liverpool. This bird is termed a <i>Liver</i>, from which that flourishing town derived its name,
  and is now standing on the spot where the <i>Pool</i> was, on the verge of which the <i>Liver</i>
  was killed." The arms of the town of Liverpool, however, as Mr. Howard Saunders points out, are
  "comparatively modern, and seem to have no reference to the ibis. The bird which was adopted in
  the arms of the [extinct] Earls of Liverpool was described in a former edition of 'Burke's
  Peerage' as a cormorant, holding in the beak a branch of seaweed. In the Plantagenet seal of
  Liverpool, which is believed to be of the time of King John, the bird has the appearance of a
  dove, bearing in its bill a sprig of olive, apparently intended to refer to the advantages that
  commerce would derive from peace."</p>

  <p>The glossy ibis has been found breeding in colonies of thousands in Slavonia. The nests are
  large structures formed of sticks and a few weeds, never far from the water, and many even, in the
  colony referred to, were so near the surface that they appeared to be floating. The eggs, three or
  four in number, are of a beautiful greenish blue. The young, while still unable to fly, climb
  actively among the branches of the trees in which the nest is placed, clinging so firmly with the
  feet as to be removed with difficulty.</p>

  <p>In the first mentioned of these two groups the <span class="sc">Common Heron</span> is the best
  known in the British Islands. Indeed, there must be few who have not encountered it in a wild
  state at some time or another. In suitable spots it may occasionally be met with standing mid-leg
  in water on the look-out for eels and other fish and frogs, a diet varied by an occasional young
  bird or small mammal. Sometimes this prey is hunted, so to speak, the bird walking along with a
  slow, measured step, striking with lightning rapidity and wonderful precision the moment its
  victim is sighted, whilst at others it stands motionless, as when fishing, striking the instant
  the unsuspecting eel or flounder comes within range.</p>

      <p class="sp3">YOUNG COMMON HERONS.</p>
      <p class="sp0">These birds have not yet acquired their full plumage.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>From the earliest times until the reign of William IV. the heron was specially protected by
  law, being held in high regard both as an object of sport and a desirable addition to the
  dinner-table. So late as James I.'s time an Act was passed making it illegal to shoot with any gun
  within 600 paces of a heronry. The favourite way of taking the heron was by hawking, a sport which
  has furnished material in abundance both for poet and painter.</p>

  <p>Herons breed in more or less extensive colonies, the nests&mdash;somewhat bulky structures,
  made of sticks and lined with twigs&mdash;being placed in the tops of high trees. From four to six
  is the normal number of eggs, and these are of a beautiful sea-green colour. The young are thinly
  clad in long, hairy-looking down, and for some considerable time are quite helpless.</p>

  <p>Similar in appearance to the common heron is the American <span class="sc">Great Blue
  Heron</span>, though it is by no means the largest of the herons, as its name might seem to imply.
  This distinction belongs to the <span class="sc">Goliath Heron</span>. A native of Africa, it is
  remarkable not only for its size, but for an extraordinary development of long, loose feathers
  hanging down from the lower part of the breast, and bearing a strange resemblance to an apron,
  concealing the upper part of the legs.</p>

  <p>Passing over many species, we pause to descant on the <span class="sc">Egrets</span>. These are
  numbered <span class="pagenum" id="page445"><span class="smaller">{445}</span></span>amongst the
  most unfortunate of birds, and this because of the gracefulness and beauty of certain parts of the
  plumage worn during the breeding-season, which are coveted alike by Eastern magnates and Western
  women. The feathers in question are those known as "egrets," or, more commonly, "ospreys"; and
  their collection, as Professor Newton points out, causes some of "the most abominable cruelty
  practised in the animal world." The wearing of these feathers can no longer be excused; for Sir
  William Flower in England, and Professor W. E. D. Scott in America, have given the greatest
  publicity to the horrible barbarities and sickening scenes which are perpetrated by the men sent
  to gather in this harvest. The egrets, however, are not the only victims, as a glance at the
  milliners' windows will show, the distorted and mangled bodies of almost every known species of
  the smaller birds being therein displayed! Many of those who wear these "ornaments" offend
  unwittingly; it is certain that if they realised the suffering and waste of life that this method
  of decoration entails they would eschew any but ostrich feathers for ever.</p>

      <p class="sp0">This is a North American bird of skulking and nocturnal habits.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Cattle-egret</span>, better known as the <span class="sc">Buff-backed
  Heron</span>, breeds in the southern portion of the Spanish Peninsula, where from March to autumn
  it is very common in the marshes of Andalusia, thousands congregating there, herding with the
  cattle, from the backs of which they may be often seen picking off the ticks; hence the Spaniards
  give them a name meaning "cattle-cleaners."</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Night-herons</span> are comparatively small birds, and derive their name
  from their habit of turning night into day, waking up only as the shades of evening fall to hunt
  for food; only during the breeding-season is this habit broken through, when they are obliged to
  hunt <span class="pagenum" id="page446"><span class="smaller">{446}</span></span>for food for
  their young during the daytime. They breed in colonies, in bushes or low trees in the
  neighbourhood of swamps. In some places they are protected&mdash;as, for instance, round the Great
  Honam Temple at Canton, where these birds are held sacred.</p>

  <p>Colonel Swinhoe, says Mr. Howard Saunders, describes the nests "as placed thickly in some
  venerable banyans, the granite slabs that form the pavement beneath the trees being bedaubed with
  the droppings of old and young, while from the nests arose the chattering cry of the callow
  broods, for which the parent birds were catering the whole day long, becoming more active at
  sunset. As darkness set in, the noise and hubbub from the trees rose to a fearful pitch."</p>

  <p>In Hungary large numbers of herons and egrets breed together in the marshes, egrets and
  night-herons breeding together with the common and purple herons. Landbeck, an enthusiastic
  ornithologist, writes of such heronries: "The clamour in these breeding-places is so tremendous
  and singular in its character as almost to defy description; it must be heard before a person can
  form any idea of what it is like. At a distance these hideous noises blend with a confused roar,
  so as in some way to resemble the hubbub caused by a party of drunken Hungarian peasants; and it
  is only on a nearer approach the separate notes of the two species, the common and the
  night-heron, can be distinguished&mdash;namely, 'craik' and 'quack,' to which the notes of the
  young, 'zek-zek-zek,' ... in different keys, serve as an accompaniment. When close to, the noise
  is tremendous and the stench unbearable. This, together with the sight of dozens of young herons
  in every stage of putrefaction and teeming with maggots, is perfectly sickening, though the
  contemplation of life and movement in this immense heronry is a matter of interest to the true
  ornithologist.... The tops of the highest trees are usually occupied by the nests of the common
  heron; a little lower down is the habitation of the shy and beautiful <span class="sc">Great
  Egret</span>, while in the forks of the lowest branches the night-heron takes up her abode. All
  these species build in one and the same tree, the nests numbering not infrequently as many as
  fifteen in a single tree, and yet peace invariably reigns amongst all these varieties. High over
  the trees appears the common heron, laden with booty, announcing his arrival with a hoarse
  'craaich,' when, changing his note to a goose-like 'da-da-da-da,' he either jerks the provender
  down the throats of the ever-hungry youngsters or throws it up before them, when the fish are
  greedily swallowed, amid a desperate accompaniment of 'goh&eacute;-&eacute;-&eacute;-&eacute;, goh&eacute;-&eacute;-&eacute;-&eacute;',' a sound much
  resembling the frantic cry of a calf which is being lifted into a farmer's market-cart. The
  conduct of the more cautious egret is very different. Circling far above the nest, she first
  satisfies herself that no foe is hidden below before she alights among her family, which are much
  quieter and less hasty than their cousins. The night-herons, on the contrary, approach their nests
  from all sides, high and low, their crops filled with frogs, fish, and insects. A deep 'qu&acirc;k' or
  'gowek' announces the arrival of the old bird already from some distance, to which the young
  answer, while feeding, with a note resembling 'queht, queht,' or 'quehao&acirc;heh, quehoehah'. As soon
  as the parents have taken their departure the youngsters recommence their concert, and from every
  nest uninterrupted cries of 'tzik, tzik, tzik, tzek-tzek, tzek,' and 'g&eacute;tt, g&eacute;tt-g&eacute;tt,' are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page447"><span class="smaller">{447}</span></span>the order of the day. This
  amusement is varied by the nestlings climbing out among the branches till they reach the top of
  the tree, whence they can have a good look-out, and can see the old birds returning home from a
  long distance, though they are in many cases often mistaken in their identity."</p>

  <p class="sp3">A common North American bird is the so-called <span class="sc">Green Heron</span>,
  known by many local aliases, such as "Fly-up-the-Creek," "Chalk-line," and "Chuckle-head." Seen at
  short range, its plumage is lustrous and beautiful, but this disappears as soon as the bird takes
  wing. The nest is of very loose construction; and a story is told of one which was such a shaky
  concern that every time the old birds jarred it a stick fell off, and the structure grew smaller
  and smaller, until the day when the young were ready to fly there were but three sticks left;
  finally these parted, and the little herons found themselves perching on the branch that once held
  the nest!</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Bitterns.</span></p>

  <p>These are birds of a remarkable type of coloration, adapted to aid their skulking habits. The
  coloration partakes so completely of the nature of the undergrowth among which they dwell, that,
  aided by certain peculiar habits described below, they succeed in harmonising so perfectly with
  their surroundings as to render themselves invisible to their enemies.</p>

      <p>INDIAN CATTLE-EGRET.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;" class="sp0"> This is a species of buff-backed heron, and earns
      its name from its habit of hovering round cattle for the sake of picking off the ticks by
      which they are infested.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The best-known species is the <span class="sc">Common Bittern</span>, though this epithet is no
  longer applicable, for at the present time it is but an occasional visitant to Britain. Once it
  was plentiful enough, as the frequent references both in prose and poetry bear witness. These
  references have been inspired mainly by its very peculiar note, made apparently only during the
  breeding-season. This sound is variously described as "booming," "bellowing," and "bumping," and
  many are the theories which have been invented to account for its origin. Thomson, in "The
  Seasons," says that it is made whilst the beak is thrust into the mud<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="poem poemc20">
    <p>The bittern knows his time, with bill ingulf'd</p>
    <p>To shake the sounding marsh.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Chaucer, that it is caused whilst it is immersed under water; and Dryden represents it as <span
  class="pagenum" id="page448"><span class="smaller">{448}</span></span>made by thrusting the bill
  into a reed. Mr. J. E. Harting is one of the few who have actually watched the bird during the
  production of the sound, and from him we gather that it is made by expelling the air from the
  throat whilst the head is held vertically upwards.</p>

  <p>The protective coloration and the peculiar habits associated therewith have only recently been
  recognised. These birds, when threatened, do not take flight, but immediately bring the body and
  the long neck and pointed head into one vertical line, and remain absolutely motionless so long as
  the cause of alarm persists. The peculiar coloration of the body harmonises so perfectly with the
  surrounding undergrowth, that, as just remarked, detection is well-nigh impossible. Although the
  pattern and tone of the coloration vary in the various species of bittern&mdash;which occur all
  over the world&mdash;this principle of protection obtains in all.</p>

  <p>The drainage of the fens is answerable for the extinction of the bittern in England.</p>

  <p>We would draw special attention to the great length of the feathers on the neck, which, when
  the bird is excited, are extended on either side to form an enormous feather shield. This is
  admirably shown in the photograph below, which represents a bittern preparing to strike. It is a
  curious fact that, when extended, the hind part of the neck is protected only by a thin coat of
  down. When the excitement has passed, the elongated feathers fall again, and, curling round the
  unprotected area, give the bird the appearance of having a perfectly normally clothed neck.</p>

  <p>A wounded bittern will strike at either man or dog, and is extremely dangerous, owing to the
  sharpness of its dagger-like bill. If a dog advances on one not entirely disabled, the bird
  immediately turns itself upon its back, and fights with beak and claws, after the fashion of a
  wounded hawk or owl. Owing to the way in which the neck can be tucked up, by throwing it into a
  series of curves, and then suddenly extended, great danger attends the approach of the unwary.</p>

  <p>The bittern is by no means particular in its choice of food, small mammals, birds, lizards,
  frogs, fishes, and beetles being alike palatable. The writer remembers taking from the gullet and
  stomach of one of these birds no less than four water-voles, three of which had apparently been
  killed only just before it was shot, for the process of digestion had hardly begun.</p>

  <p>On migration these birds appear to travel in flocks of considerable size, since Captain Kelham
  reports having seen as many as fifty together high up in the air, when between Alexandria and
  Cairo. Curiously enough, they flew like "a gaggle" of geese&mdash;in the form of a V; but every
  now and then he noticed they, for some reason or other, got into great confusion.</p>

  <p>At one time the flesh of the bittern was much esteemed as food for the table, being likened in
  taste and colour to the leveret, with some of the flavour of wild-fowl. Sir Thomas Browne, who
  flourished during the middle of the seventeenth century, says that young bitterns were considered
  better eating than young herons.</p>

  <p>In the fourteenth century it bred in considerable numbers in the fens of Cambridgeshire, and
  was so highly esteemed as a bird for the table that the taking of its eggs was forbidden. At a
  court-baron of the Bishop of Ely, according to Mr. J. E. Harting, held at Littleport in the
  eleventh year of the reign of Edward II., several people were fined for taking the eggs of the
  bittern and carrying them out of the fen, to the great destruction of the birds. Decreasing
  steadily in numbers, the bittern continued to breed in Britain till the middle of the nineteenth
  century, one of the last nests being taken in Norfolk in 1868.</p>

      <p class="sp3">CRESTED PELICAN.</p>
      <p class="sp0">This bird derives its name from the curiously curled feathers on the top of the
      head and nape of the neck.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The members of the Pelican Tribe may be readily distinguished from other living birds by the
  fact that all their toes are united in a common fold of skin or web. In the Ducks and other
  web-footed birds only the front toes are so united.</p>

  <p>The Pelican Tribe embraces several apparently dissimilar forms, whose only claim to be grouped
  together, judged from a superficial point of view, lies in the fact that they possess the peculiar
  type of foot above mentioned. With the general appearance of the Pelican itself probably every one
  is familiar, but we had better mention here that the other representatives of the group with which
  we have now to deal are the Cormorants and Gannets, common on the British coasts, and the
  less-known Darters, Frigate-birds, and Tropic-birds; these, as we know from their anatomy, are all
  closely allied forms, and with the Pelicans make up a somewhat isolated group whose nearest allies
  appear to be the members of the Stork Tribe.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Pelican</span> figures largely in ecclesiastical heraldry as the type of
  maternal tenderness. Tradition has it that the bird, in admonishing its young, occasionally did so
  with such violence as to slay them. Remorse immediately following, the distracted parent drew
  blood from its own breast, and therewith sprinkled the victims of its wrath, which thereupon
  became restored to life again. The exhaustion following on this loss of blood was so great that
  the young had perforce to leave the nest to procure food for themselves and the sinking parent. If
  any, through lack of filial affection, refused to aid in this good work, the mother, on recovering
  strength, drove them from her presence, but the faithful children she permitted to follow her
  wherever she went.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable features of the pelican is the pouch which hangs suspended from the
  under side of the beak. This is capable of great distension, and is used, when fishing, as a sort
  of bag-net, of which the upper jaw serves as the lid. The young are fed by the female, which,
  pressing her well-filled pouch against her breast, opens her mouth and allows them to take their
  fill therefrom.</p>

  <p>Pelicans display great sagacity when fishing, a flock often combining to form a horseshoe, and,
  driving the fish into a mass, take their fill. This method, of course, is only possible when
  fishing in the estuaries of rivers or lakes, where the fish can be "rounded up," so to speak.
  Clumsy as the pelican looks, it is yet capable of wonderful powers of flight; indeed, it shares
  the honour with the vultures, storks, and adjutants as an expert in the peculiar form of flight
  known as "soaring."</p>

  <p>A North American species of pelican is remarkable in that during the breeding-season the beak
  is ornamented with a peculiar horny excrescence, which is shed as soon as that period is over.</p>

      <p class="sp3">YOUNG AUSTRALIAN PELICAN.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Pelicans, like gannets and cormorants, are hatched perfectly naked and quite
      blind.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Pelicans are natives of the tropical and temperate regions of the Old and New Worlds, and live
  in flocks often numbering many thousands. The nest is placed on the ground, and therein are
  deposited two white eggs. The young are helpless for some time after hatching.</p>

  <p>In all some six-and-thirty species of <span class="sc">Cormorants</span> are known to science,
  of which two are commonly to be met with round the British coasts, one of which also travels
  inland to establish itself on such lakes and rivers as may afford it support.</p>

  <p>In various parts of the world cormorants are taken when young and trained to catch fish:
  sometimes for sport, or&mdash;as in China&mdash;to furnish a livelihood for their owners. At one
  time the Master of the Cormorants was one of the officers in the Royal Household of England, the
  post having been created in 1611 by James I. The method of hunting is as follows:&mdash;After
  fastening a ring around the neck, the bird is cast off into the water, and, diving immediately,
  makes its way beneath the surface with incredible speed, and, seizing one fish after another,
  rises in a short space of time with its mouth full and throat distended by the fish, which it has
  been unable to swallow by reason of the restraining ring. With these captures it dutifully returns
  to its keeper, who deftly removes the fish, and either returns the bird to the water, or, giving
  it a share of the spoil, restores it to its perch.</p>

  <p>Cormorants nest either in trees or on the ground; they lay from four to six eggs, and the young
  feed themselves by thrusting their heads far down the parents' throats and helping themselves to
  the half-digested fish which they find there.</p>

  <p>The cormorant has a certain sinister appearance equalled by no other bird, so that its
  introduction in Milton's "Paradise Lost" (Book IV., 194) seems particularly appropriate. Satan, it
  will be remembered, is likened to a cormorant<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

      <p class="sp0">Young pelicans never develop long down-feathers, like gannets and
      frigate-birds.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The curious bottle-green plumage, green eyes, long hooked beak, and head surmounted by a crest
  of the smaller sea-loving representative of the two British species were doubtless familiar enough
  to Milton before blindness overtook him.</p>

  <p>Some of our readers may have made the acquaintance of the cormorant's nearest ally, the <span
  class="sc">Darter</span>, or <span class="sc">Snake-neck</span>, in the Fish-house at the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page452"><span class="smaller">{452}</span></span>Zoological Gardens of
  London. For the sake of those who have not, we may say that the darter may be described as a
  long-necked cormorant, with somewhat lighter plumage. The head is small and flat, and armed with a
  pointed, dagger-like bill, whose edges are finely toothed, with needle-like points projecting
  backwards. The neck is very long and slender; hence its name of Snake-neck. Furthermore, it is
  remarkable for a very strange "kink," formed by a peculiar arrangement of the neck-bones&mdash;an
  arrangement intimately associated with its peculiar method of capturing its prey, which, as with
  the cormorant, is pursued under water. How dexterously this is done may be seen any day in the
  Fish-house at the Zoological Gardens, where, as we have already mentioned, these birds are kept.
  At feeding-time they are turned loose into a large tank into which a number of small fish have
  been placed. The birds dive as soon as they reach the water, and with surprising speed chase their
  prey till within short range. Then, by a sudden bayonet-like lunge, made possible by the peculiar
  "kink" in the neck, a victim is transfixed, brought to the surface, released from the bill by a
  series of sudden jerks, tossed into the air, and dexterously caught and swallowed.</p>

      <p class="sp3">CORMORANT.</p>
      <p class="sp0">In the spring a slight crest is developed, and a white patch appears on the
      thigh.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The darter is found in Africa, India, the Malay region, Australia, and South America,
  frequenting the banks of rivers, lakes, and swamps, sometimes singly, sometimes in pairs or in
  immense flocks.</p>

  <p>Very different from either of the foregoing species, both in build and coloration, is the <span
  class="sc">Gannet</span>. In its habits it is also different. The adult bird is about the size of
  a goose, white in colour, and armed with a powerful pointed bill. The young have a quite distinct
  plumage, being deep brown, speckled with white, this livery being worn for nearly three years.</p>

  <p>The greater part of a gannet's lifetime seems to be spent upon the wing, a fact which implies a
  very different method of feeding from that followed by the cormorant and darter; and this is
  actually the case. Preying upon shoals of herring, mackerel, sprats, or pilchards, the birds,
  flying singly or in flocks, as soon as the fish are discovered, rise, soar in circles to such a
  height as experience shows best calculated to carry them by a downward motion to the required
  depth, and then, partially closing the wings, plunge upon their prey, and rarely without success,
  the time which elapses between the plunge and the immersion being about fifteen seconds. A flock
  of gannets feeding is a really wonderful sight, and can be witnessed in many places around the
  British coasts, for the gannet is one of the very common British birds. The pilchard-fishermen off
  the Cornish coast learn when the shoals are at hand, and the direction in which they are
  travelling, by the actions of these birds. A very cruel experiment is sometimes practised upon the
  gannet, based upon its well-known method of fishing. A herring is tied to a beam and set adrift,
  and the bird, not noticing the trap, plunges with its usual velocity upon the fish, with the
  result that it is killed instantly by the shock of the contact.</p>

  <p>Gannets breed in colonies of thousands on the islands off the east and west coasts of Scotland.
  They lay but a single egg, in a nest composed of seaweed deposited in inaccessible crags of
  precipitous cliffs. The young are at first naked; later they become clothed with long white down.
  "At one time," says Mr. Howard Saunders, "young gannets were much esteemed as food, from 1,500 to
  2,000 being taken in a season during the month of August. They are hooked up, killed, and flung
  into the sea, where a boat is waiting to pick up the bodies. These are plucked, cleaned, and half
  roasted, after which they are sold at from eightpence to a shilling each.... The fat is boiled
  down into oil, and the feathers, after being well baked, are used for stuffing beds, about a
  hundred birds producing a stone of feathers."</p>

  <p>Gannets present one or two structural peculiarities of sufficient interest to mention here. In
  most birds, it will be remembered, the nostrils open on each side of the beak; but in the gannet
  no trace of true nostrils remains; and the same may almost be said of the cormorant and darter. In
  gannets, however, a slight indication of their sometime existence remains, though the nostril
  itself no longer serves as an air-passage; and these birds are compelled to breathe through the
  mouth. Again, the tongue, like the nostrils, has also been reduced to a mere vestige. Stranger
  still is the fact that immediately under the skin there lies an extensive system of air-cells of
  large size, which can be inflated or emptied at will. Many of these cells dip down between the
  muscles of the body, so that the whole organism is pervaded with air-cells, all of which are in
  connection with the lungs.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Frigate-birds</span> are remarkable in more ways than one. To begin with,
  their general appearance may be described as that of a small, long-winged, fork-tailed albatross,
  mounted upon particularly diminutive legs, so short as to do little more than raise the body off
  the ground. Their flight is wonderfully graceful, and capable of being sustained for considerable
  periods; for, like the gannets, they pass most of their time on the wing. They feed upon
  surface-fish, which they capture from the surface of the water without alighting, or upon fish
  which they take from the gannets of the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>Frigate-birds build their nests in trees, on low bushes, or on the ground, and sometimes upon
  ledges of precipitous cliffs. The nest is a loose structure composed of sticks, and its
  construction is accompanied by much pilfering from one another. Only a single egg is laid.</p>

  <p>About the beginning of January the male acquires a very remarkable pouch of brilliant scarlet
  skin, which hangs beneath the beak. Frigate-birds are found all over the world within the
  tropics.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Tropic-birds</span>, or <span class="sc">Boatswain-birds</span>, as they
  are sometimes called, are more like gulls or the heavier species of terns in general appearance,
  and in no way resemble superficially the forms with which they are associated, save in the fact
  that all the toes are enclosed in the same web. A study of their anatomy, however, leaves little
  doubt that these birds are really members of the Pelican Tribe.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Either pure white, relieved with black, or of a beautiful apricot-yellow, with
  similar black markings, with a powerful bill and long tapering tail, the tropic-bird is one of the
  most beautiful of sea-birds. There are altogether about six species of tropic-birds, distributed
  over the Pacific and Indian Oceans. They nest in hollows of cliffs or holes in trees, and lay a
  single egg, which bears some resemblance to that of a kestrel.</p>

  <p>Familiar as are most of our readers with all save the first mentioned of these birds, yet few
  probably suspect how great a wealth of forms this group displays. All are more or less aquatic in
  their habits, of heavy build, with long necks and small heads, short legs, and short wings and
  tails. The young are hatched covered with a peculiar kind of down, which more nearly resembles
  that of the Ostrich Tribe than the down of other birds, and they run about or accompany their
  parents to the water either immediately or a few hours after hatching. Several species have become
  domesticated, and in some cases have given rise to peculiar breeds, whilst many are much in demand
  for the purpose of enlivening ornamental waters.</p>

      <p class="sp0">This is one of the most esteemed of all domesticated breeds.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The screamers are generally regarded as primitive members of the group with which they are now
  associated; but in many respects they are quite peculiar. Not the least interesting of their
  habits is the great predilection they observe for soaring in the air at immense altitudes,
  uttering the while the curious cry to which they owe their name. Several birds often do this at
  once. Yet stranger is the fact that they not seldom gather together in vast flocks to sing in
  concert. Mr. Hudson, for instance, states that the species known as the <span class="sc">Crested
  Screamer</span> on one occasion surprised him by "an awful and overpowering burst of 'melody,'"
  which saluted him from half a million of voices at an out-of-the-way spot in the pampas one
  evening at nine o'clock; and, again, once at noon he heard flock after flock take up their song
  round the entire circuit of a certain lake, each flock waiting its turn to sing, and only stopping
  when the duty had been performed.</p>

  <p>Like the gannet, these birds are richly supplied with air-cells between the body and the skin,
  and between many of the muscles; so highly are these cells developed, that it is said a crackling
  sound is emitted when pressure is applied to the skin.</p>

  those of certain of the Plover Tribe (page <a href="#page421">421</a>), though in the latter only
  one spur is present on each wing.</p>

  <p>The division of the remainder of this group into Ducks, Geese, and Swans is generally
  recognised, but no hard-and-fast line can yet be drawn between the several sections. We must
  regard them as representing adaptations to peculiar modes of life, which appear to be most marked
  in the duck-like forms. These may be divided into <span class="sc">Fresh-water Ducks</span>, <span
  class="sc">Salt-water Ducks</span>, <span class="sc">Spiny-tailed Ducks</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Mergansers</span>.</p>

  <p>Of the <span class="sc">Fresh-water Ducks</span>, the most familiar is the <span
  class="sc">Wild-duck</span>, or <span class="sc">Mallard</span>. This is a resident British bird,
  and also the parent of the domesticated stock, which frequently closely resembles the wild form.
  In this species, as with the majority of the fresh-water ducks, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page458"><span class="smaller">{458}</span></span>the males wear a distinctive livery; but the
  males for a few weeks during the summer assume more or less completely the livery of the female, a
  process aptly described as going into "eclipse." The assumption of the female dress at this season
  is necessary, since it harmonises completely with the surrounding foliage, and so effectually
  conceals the bird at a time when it is peculiarly helpless; for, as with all birds, the quills or
  flight-feathers are cast off by the process known as moulting once a year, but instead of being
  replaced in pairs, and the flight remaining unaffected, they are shed all at once, so that escape
  from enemies must be sought by concealment.</p>

  with the sole object, it is generally believed, of keeping the eggs warm; but it is possible that
  the down is removed as much for the sake of bringing the warm surface of the body in closer
  contact with the eggs. The site chosen for the nest is exceedingly varied; usually the nest is
  placed on the ground and near the water, but sometimes in a hedgerow or in a wood, and
  occasionally in trees, and instances are on record where the deserted nests of hawks and crows
  have been appropriated. At such times the young seem to be brought to the ground by the parent,
  which carries them down in her bill. It is some time before the wings of the young birds are big
  enough to carry them; indeed, they are quite full grown in so far as the body is concerned. At
  this stage they are known as "flappers." Advantage was at one time taken of their helplessness in
  the "sport" known as "flapper-shooting." On other occasions numbers of people assembled and "beat"
  a vast tract of country, driving these young flappers before them to a given spot where nets were
  placed, in which as many as 150 dozen have been taken at one time. Fortunately this practice has
  been abolished by Act of Parliament.</p>

  <p>Several very distinct <span class="pagenum" id="page459"><span
  class="smaller">{459}</span></span>domesticated breeds of ducks have been derived from the
  mallard. The commonest breed differs but little, save in its great size, from the wild parent
  form, but the most esteemed are those known as the <span class="sc">Rouen</span> and <span
  class="sc">Aylesbury</span>. The <span class="sc">Penguin-Duck</span> is the most aberrant and the
  ugliest of these breeds, having a peculiarly upright, awkward carriage, and very small wings.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Salt-water Ducks</span>, or <span class="sc">Diving-ducks</span>, are for
  the most part of a heavier build than the foregoing species, and many are of a sombre coloration.
  All the species are expert divers, and in consequence have the legs, which are short, placed far
  backwards, and this causes them to assume a more upright carriage when on land. The curious bony
  bulb at the base of the windpipe found in the fresh-water species becomes in the salt-water forms
  greatly enlarged, and its walls incompletely ossified, leaving large spaces to be filled by
  peculiarly delicate sheets of membrane. The majority of the species in this section frequent the
  open sea, but some occur inland.</p>

  <p>One of the most useful, and at the same time most ornamental, of this section is the <span
  class="sc">Eider-duck</span>, the male in full plumage being a truly magnificent bird: the female,
  as in the majority of ducks, is clad in sober colours. In Iceland and Norway the eider-duck is
  strictly protected, a fine being imposed for killing it during the breeding-season, or even for
  firing a gun near its haunts. This most unusual care is, however, by no means of a disinterested
  kind, but is extended solely that certain privileged persons may rob the birds of their eggs and
  the down on which they rest, the latter being the valuable eiderdown so much in demand for
  bed-coverlets and other purposes. "The eggs and down," says Professor Newton, "are taken at
  intervals of a few days by the owners of the 'eider-fold,' and the birds are thus kept depositing
  both during the whole season.... Every duck is ultimately allowed to hatch an egg or two to keep
  up the stock." Mr. W. C. Sheppard gives an interesting account of a visit to an eider-colony on an
  island off the coast of Iceland. "On landing," he says, "the ducks and their nests were
  everywhere. Great brown ducks sat upon their nests in masses, and at every step started from under
  our feet. It was with difficulty we avoided treading on some of the nests. On the coast of the
  opposite shore was a wall built of large stones ... about 3 feet high and of considerable
  thickness. At the bottom, on both sides of it, alternate stones had been left out, so as to form a
  series of square apartments for the ducks to nest in. Almost every apartment was occupied.... The
  house itself was a marvel. The earthen walls that surrounded it, and the window embrasures, were
  occupied by ducks. On the ground the house was fringed with ducks. On the turf slopes of its roof
  we could see ducks, and a duck sat on the door-scraper. The grassy banks had been cut into square
  patches, about 18 inches having been removed, and each hollow had been filled with ducks. A
  windmill was infested, and so were all the outhouses, mounds, rocks, and crevices. The ducks were
  everywhere. Many were so tame that we could stroke them on their nests, and the good lady told us
  that there was scarcely a duck on the island that would not allow her to take its eggs without
  flight or fear."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page460"><span class="smaller">{460}</span></span></div>

  <p>The nest is composed externally of seaweed, and lined with down, which is plucked by the female
  from her breast as incubation proceeds, till eventually it completely conceals the eggs. Each nest
  yields about one-sixth of a pound, and is worth, on the spot, from twelve to fifteen shillings a
  pound.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Pochards</span>, <span class="sc">Scaups</span>, <span
  class="sc">Golden-eyes</span>, and <span class="sc">Scoters</span> are relatives of the
  eider-duck; but since all resemble the latter in their general mode of life, we need not consider
  them here.</p>

      <p class="sp3">CAPE BARREN GOOSE.</p>
      <p class="sp0">This bird is a native of South-east Australia and Tasmania, and remarkable for
      its short beak.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Mergansers</span> and <span class="sc">Smews</span>, to which reference
  has been made, differ markedly from all the ducks so far considered in the peculiar formation of
  the bill, which is relatively long and narrow, with its edges armed with sharp, tooth-like
  processes projecting backwards towards the back of the mouth. These processes are really only
  horny spines, and have no relation to teeth, although they are used, as teeth would be, for
  holding slippery prey, such as fish, which form the greater part of the diet of these birds.</p>

  <p>So far, in all the ducks which we have considered, the male differs conspicuously from the
  female in plumage; but in the forms we are now about to describe both sexes are coloured
  alike.</p>

  <p>The first is the <span class="sc">Common Sheldrake</span>, which seems to lie somewhere on the
  borderland between the Ducks and the Geese. It is a very beautiful bird, conspicuously marked with
  broad bands of orange-chestnut, white, and black. The beak being coral-red in colour, and further
  ornamented by a peculiar fleshy knob at its base, serves to set off the glossy bottle-green colour
  of the head and neck. As appears to be invariably the case where both sexes are coloured alike,
  the female builds her nest in a hole, generally a rabbit-burrow, whilst the young have a distinct
  livery, duller in tone than that of the parent. The female sheldrake breeds in Britain, and may be
  frequently seen at sea flying in small parties, which have been likened to a flock of
  butterflies.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page461"><span class="smaller">{461}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Geese</span> include birds of somewhat conspicuous coloration, besides a
  considerable number of more subdued aspect. The sexes are distinguished by different names, the
  female being known as the Goose, the male as the Gander, whilst the young is the Gosling. As we
  have already mentioned, there is no hard-and-fast line to be drawn between the three sections of
  this group. The Ducks are connected by the Sheldrakes with the Geese, through the Spur-winged
  Goose, the Egyptian and Orinoco Geese, and certain other species which cannot be alluded to on
  this occasion.</p>

      <p class="sp3">AUSTRALIAN PYGMY GOOSE.</p>
      <p class="sp0">The pygmy geese are expert divers.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Spur-winged Geese</span>, of which there are two species, are African
  birds, and derive their name from the long spur seated on the wing.</p>

  <p>A still more remarkable form is the <span class="sc">Half-webbed Goose</span>, so called from
  the fact that its feet are only partially webbed. It has a black-and-white plumage, a hooked beak,
  and a large warty prominence on the front of the head. It spends most of its time perched on the
  branches of the Australian tea-trees, and rarely enters the water. The windpipe is peculiar, being
  coiled in several folds between the skin and the breast-muscles.</p>

  <p>From these peculiar forms we pass to the true geese. The largest living species is the <span
  class="sc">Chinese</span> or <span class="sc">Guinea-goose</span> of Eastern Siberia, regarded as
  the stock from which the domesticated geese of Eastern countries have been derived.</p>

  <p>European domesticated geese have been derived from the <span class="sc">Grey</span> or <span
  class="sc">Grey-lag Goose</span>, a species at one time exceedingly common in England, breeding in
  considerable numbers in the fen districts, where the young were frequently taken and reared with
  the large flock of domesticated geese commonly kept at that time for the sake of their feathers.
  The grey-lag goose, however, has long ceased to breed in England, though a few still nest in
  Scotland. The most important breeds derived from the grey-lag are the <span
  class="sc">Toulouse</span> and <span class="sc">Emden</span>. Other British species are the <span
  class="sc">Bean-goose</span>, <span class="sc">Pink-footed</span> and <span
  class="sc">White-fronted Geese</span>, and the <span class="sc">"Black" Brent</span> and <span
  class="sc">Barnacle-geese</span>, in all of which the sexes are precisely similar in coloration
  and subdued in tone.</p>

  <p>In the New World some very beautiful white geese are found, which are still more interesting in
  that the females have a different coloration. These are the <span class="sc">Kelp-</span> and
  <span class="sc">Upland-geese</span> of Patagonia and the Falklands. The female of the kelp-goose
  is brownish black above and black barred with white below, whilst the female of the upland-goose
  is rufous and black in colour. The latter may be seen in London parks.</p>

  <p>Lastly, we have a few species known from their small size as <span class="sc">Pygmy
  Geese</span> of Australia, India, and Africa. Perhaps the best known is the Indian species, called
  the <span class="sc">Cotton-teal</span>. <span class="pagenum" id="page462"><span
  class="smaller">{462}</span></span>They are tiny birds, resembling small ducks rather than geese,
  and dive admirably, a feat which the larger species do not perform.</p>

      musical note, resembling the word "whoop" quickly repeated.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Swans</span> are linked with the Geese through a very beautiful South
  American species, known as the <span class="sc">Coscoroba Swan</span>. It is the smallest of all
  the swans, pure white in colour, save the tips of the greater wing-quills, which are black, and
  the coral-red bill and feet.</p>

  <p>Of all the swans, probably the best known is the <span class="sc">Mute Swan</span>, the
  semi-domesticated descendants of which are so common on ornamental waters. For hundreds of years
  the latter were jealously guarded, none but the larger freeholders being allowed to keep them, and
  then not without a licence from the Crown; with this licence was coupled an obligation to mark
  each swan with a particular mark, cut with a knife or other instrument through the skin of the
  beak, whereby ownership might be established.</p>

  <p>It would seem that these swans and their descendants were not derived from the native wild
  stock, but were introduced into England, it is said, from Cyprus by Richard I. At the present day
  large "swanneries" have almost ceased to exist. Perhaps the largest is that of the Earl of
  Ilchester, at Abbotsbury, near Weymouth. In 1878 between 1,300 and 1,400 swans were to be seen
  there at one time, but latterly the number has been reduced to about half.</p>

  <p>Although swans do not perhaps stand so high in the general esteem as table delicacies as with
  our forefathers, there are yet many who appreciate the flesh of this bird; but the St. Helen's
  Swan-pit at Norwich is the only place in England where they are systematically fattened for the
  table. Here from 70 to 200 cygnets&mdash;as the young swans are called&mdash;caught in the
  neighbouring rivers, are placed early in August, and fed upon cut grass and barley till Christmas,
  when they are fit for table, weighing, when "dressed," about 15 lbs., <span class="pagenum"
  id="page463"><span class="smaller">{463}</span></span>and fetching, if purchased alive at the pit,
  about two guineas each. The pit is constructed of brickwork, and is about 74 feet long, 32 feet
  wide, and 6 feet deep&mdash;the water, admitted from the river, being about 2 feet deep. The food
  is placed in floating troughs. The birds, "when so disposed," says Mr. Southwell, "leave the water
  by walking up a sloping stage, and thus obtain access to a railed-in enclosure, where they may
  rest and preen themselves."</p>

  <p>The beautiful swan-like carriage, so familiar in the floating bird, seems to belong only to the
  mute swan, the other species of white swans carrying the neck more or less straight, and keeping
  the wings closely folded to the body.</p>

  <p>No greater anomaly could at one time have been imagined than a <span class="sc">Black
  Swan</span>. For centuries it was considered to be an impossibility. We owe the discovery of such
  a bird to the Dutch navigator Willem de Vlaming, who, more than 200 years ago, captured the first
  specimen at the mouth of what is now known, in consequence, as the Swan River. A year after their
  capture accounts reached England through the burgomaster of Amsterdam, and these were published by
  the Royal Society in 1698. The bird is now fairly common on ornamental waters, where its
  sooty-black plumage, set off by pure white quill-feathers and coral-red bill, contrasts strongly
  with the typical snow-white mute swan, generally kept with it.</p>

  <p>Equally interesting is the handsome <span class="sc">Black-necked Swan</span> of South America.
  In this species the plumage is pure white, save that of the neck, which is black. The distribution
  of this species is practically the same as that of the Coscoroba swan. Breeding freely in
  confinement, it has become a fairly common bird on ornamental waters. It shares with the mute swan
  the reputation of gracefulness when afloat, swimming with the neck curved and wings raised.</p>

  <p>At one time the boundaries of this group were much larger than now, for within them were
  included at least one form which has since proved to belong to the Crane Tribe: we allude to the
  Seriema (page <a href="#page428">428</a>), and also to the Owls. This classification was based on
  the very remarkable superficial resemblance to the typical birds of prey which those forms bear.
  Modern ornithologists regard as birds of prey only the forms known as the New World Vultures, the
  Secretary-bird, and the Falcons, Eagles, Vultures, Buzzards, and the numerous smaller forms
  commonly classed as "Hawks."</p>

  <p>One of the most important members of the group is the <span class="sc">Condor</span>, one of
  the largest of flying birds, and when on the wing the most majestic. "When the condors," says
  Darwin, "are wheeling in a flock round and round any spot, their flight is beautiful. Except when
  rising off the ground, I do not recollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings. Near
  Lima I watched several for nearly half an hour, without once taking <span class="pagenum"
  id="page465"><span class="smaller">{465}</span></span>off my eyes; they moved in large curves,
  sweeping in circles, descending and ascending, without giving a single flap." One which he shot
  measured, from tip to tip of the fully expanded wings, 8&frac12; feet.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The fleshy crest on the beak is developed in the females as well as in the
      males.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The condor, like its smaller relatives, hunts by sight, and not, as was at one time believed,
  by smell, feeding on the dead bodies of guanacos which have died a natural death or been killed by
  pumas, and upon other dead animals. In the neighbourhood where sheep and goats are kept, they are
  much dreaded, as they will attack the young kids and lambs. The flock-owners on this account wage
  constant war against them, capturing them by enclosing a carcase within a narrow space, and when
  the condors are gorged galloping up on horseback and killing them, for when this bird has not
  space to run it cannot rise from the ground. Sometimes the trees on which they roost are marked,
  and when night falls a man climbs the tree and captures them with a noose, for they are very heavy
  sleepers.</p>

  <p>The condor ranges from the Andes of Ecuador, Peru, and Chili southwards to the Rio Negro on the
  east coast of Patagonia. It lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare rock projecting from
  precipitous cliffs, and the young are said to be unable to fly till after they are a year old. As
  will be seen in the photographs, the head of the male is crowned by a bare, fleshy caruncle,
  which, like the surrounding bare skin, is of a dull reddish colour: lower down the neck is a frill
  of pure white down, which forms a conspicuous contrast with the glossy black plumage of the rest
  of the body and wings.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">King-vulture</span> is a much smaller bird, but the bare parts of the head
  are much more brilliantly, even gaudily coloured, the combinations being orange, purple, and
  crimson. The plumage is creamy white and black. It is a comparatively rare bird, and but little is
  known concerning its breeding habits. The female is much more soberly clad than her mate. The
  king-vulture has a more northerly range than the condor, extending from Brazil to Mexico, Texas,
  and Florida.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The bare parts of the head are of a brick-red colour.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">Other species are the small <span class="sc">Black Vulture</span>, a dull,
  uninteresting-looking bird, and the <span class="sc">Californian Vulture</span>. This latter is a
  large species, and in the expanse of wing may even exceed the condor. At one time its
  extermination seemed certain, owing to its falling a victim to the poisoned meat laid out by the
  stock-keepers for carnivorous mammals, but in the more barren and inaccessible regions it appears
  to be on the increase.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Secretary-bird.</span></p>

  <p>The second of the three main divisions into which the Birds of Prey are divided is reserved for
  the <span class="sc">Secretary-bird</span>. This bird derives its name from the crest of long
  feathers which bear a fanciful resemblance to the quill-pens a clerk is supposed to stick above
  his ear. It differs from all the other members of the Hawk Tribe in the exceedingly long legs,
  which in the young are said to be so fragile as to fracture if the bird is suddenly alarmed. It
  feeds chiefly on insects and reptiles, especially snakes, for which last it seems to have a
  special liking. It attacks even the most venomous species, striking at them with its powerful
  wings and pounding them with its feet, jumping upon them with great force, till rendered helpless,
  when they are at once swallowed head-foremost. On account of its great value as a snake-eater it
  has been accorded special protection, though unfortunately there is a tendency on the part of
  English settlers to relax this, on account of the fact that it will occasionally eat animals
  coming within the scope of "game." Valuable as the latter may be, there yet seems no justification
  for such a course.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The secretary-bird, which is a South African species, though extending northwards
  as far as Abyssinia, builds a huge nest of sticks in low bushes, under which will often be found
  numerous nests of the Cape sparrow, apparently the only available site on the veldt, where bushes
  are scarce. Here the sparrows are efficiently protected from the icy winds which so frequently
  sweep across this region, and apparently suffer no fear of personal violence from the fierce
  owners of the domicile above them. When sitting, the female secretary is fed by her mate. The
  young do not appear to leave the nest for five or six months. They are frequently taken from the
  nest and brought up as household pets, becoming not only very tame, but exceedingly useful.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Eagle and Falcon Tribe.</span></p>

  <p>From the perplexing wealth of species displayed among the forms herein bracketed together, we
  can only select a few examples, which embrace, however, all the more important and interesting
  forms.</p>

  <p>Beginning with the more lowly, we start with those members of small or medium size known as
  <span class="sc">Kites</span>, and as an example of the group take the species known in the
  British Islands as the <span class="sc">Kite</span>, or <span class="sc">Glead</span>. In former
  days this bird was extremely common in England, <span class="pagenum" id="page467"><span
  class="smaller">{467}</span></span>being found in numbers not only in the rural districts, but in
  London itself, where, as old records of the fifteenth century show, it occurred in such numbers
  near London Bridge as to excite the wonder of foreigners visiting the city. These birds found an
  abundance of food in the garbage of the streets, and also of the Thames itself&mdash;"an
  observation," remarks Mr. Finn, "which throws a lurid light upon the city sanitation."</p>

  <p>In the days of falconry the kite was royal game, not, however, by legal enactment, but by
  reason of the fact that none but specially trained falcons could secure a prey with such wonderful
  powers of flight. Consequently the price of a falcon which had attained this degree of skill was
  beyond the purse of any but a king.</p>

  <p>Save on the wing, the kite is not a handsome bird, its general colour being of a pale reddish
  brown; but those who have had the good fortune to watch its flight are one and all impressed.
  Cowper admirably expresses the general admiration in the lines<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="poem poemc18">
    <p style="margin-left:4.20em">Kites that swim sublime</p>
    <p>In still repeated circles, screaming loud.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The kites may be distinguished from other members of the tribe by their forked tails. Somewhat
  of a scavenger, as we have already hinted, the kite feeds also upon such small game as moles,
  frogs, young birds, rabbits, snakes, and fish. Its partiality for young birds caused it to be much
  dreaded in the farmyard in the days when it was common; and when, with the introduction of modern
  and improved firearms, game-preserving became more strenuously prosecuted, its doom was sealed,
  for a ceaseless war was waged against it, which ended only with its extermination.</p>

      <p class="sp0">In full plumage the tail of this bird is much longer.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Nearly allied to the Kites, the <span class="sc">Honey-buzzards</span> next claim attention.
  The name Honey-buzzard is a misnomer, for honey forms no part of the bird's food. This species
  exhibits, however, a quite remarkable partiality for the immature stages of wasps and bees, the
  nests of which it tears in pieces with its feet, so as to lay bare the coveted morsels, devouring
  them on the spot, perfectly regardless of the stings of the infuriated insects, which seem unable
  to penetrate its feathers. When its favourite food is not to be had, it will feed upon corn,
  earth-worms, beetles, slugs, small birds' eggs, and moles&mdash;a diet sufficiently <span
  class="pagenum" id="page468"><span class="smaller">{468}</span></span>strange for a bird of prey.
  Honey-buzzards appear to be exemplary parents, for they are said to construct a bower of leafy
  boughs above the nest to screen the young from the sun, the boughs being replaced as they wither
  by fresh ones.</p>

  <p>The honey-buzzard occurs but rarely in England, and nowhere appears to be a very common bird,
  though it is said to be more frequently met with in Arabia and Egypt than elsewhere. On migration,
  however, it appears in unusually large numbers, the late Lord Lilford recording an occasion when
  he observed many hundreds crossing the Straits of Gibraltar from Spain to Africa. These were
  apparently on their autumnal migration to warmer winter quarters.</p>

  <p>The dash, energy, and courage which we are wont to associate with the Hawk Tribe have certainly
  not been manifest in the members of the order which we have examined so far; but these attributes
  will be evident enough in the majority of the species with which we are now about to deal. One of
  the most interesting of these fiercer forms is the <span class="sc">Osprey</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Fishing-hawk</span>. As its name implies, it feeds largely upon fish, which it captures
  with great dexterity, seizing them either with its feet from the surface of the water, or by
  plunging entirely beneath the surface, when it disappears amid a shower of spray, to emerge a
  moment later with a fish writhing in its talons. To ensure a firm grip of its slippery prey, the
  soles of its feet are armed with rough tubercles, whilst the foot is furthermore remarkable in
  that the outer toe can be turned backwards, so as to lie parallel with the hind toe&mdash;an
  arrangement rare in birds of the Hawk Tribe, but characteristic of the Owls and some other birds.
  At times, it would seem, the osprey seizes a fish too large to be raised from the water, when,
  owing to the firm hold which the claws have taken, the bird is unable to release itself, and is
  speedily dragged beneath the surface and drowned. Some have suggested that the bird falls a
  victim, not to inability to free itself, but rather to its obstinacy.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The osprey is now rare in Great Britain, though it breeds occasionally in the wilder parts of
  Scotland. It enjoys an extensive range, however, being found all over the world. In America it
  appears to be very common. On an island "off the eastern extremity of Long Island, New York,"
  writes Professor Newton, "300 nests were counted. The old birds were rearing their young close
  together, living as peaceably as so many rooks, and were equally harmless to other birds."
  Colonies of this kind are rare among birds of prey.</p>

  <p>Whilst the fiercer raptorial birds, which hunt and kill their prey, live only upon small or
  medium-sized animals, a certain section, known as the <span class="sc">Vultures</span>, feed upon
  the carcases of the largest mammals which they find either in the throes of death or already dead,
  and even far advanced in decomposition. Gathering to the feast in large crowds, even the largest
  bodies are soon demolished; and on this account the vultures are to be reckoned amongst the most
  useful of birds, speedily removing matter which in hot countries would rapidly endanger the health
  of neighbouring communities.</p>

  <p>Many years ago a great controversy was waged over the question of the faculty which guides the
  vulture in the discovery of its food, since it was a matter of common knowledge that the traveller
  might sweep the horizon in vain for a sign of these birds, yet, should a camel from a caravan fall
  out and die, or men fall in warfare, within an incredibly short space of time a crowd of vultures
  would be squabbling over the dead. Some held that the vulture was guided by scent, others by
  sight, and this latter view is now almost universally accepted. The bird's natural habit of
  soaring at an immense height enables it to survey not only immense tracts of country, but the
  actions of its neighbours soaring at the same altitude, though perhaps miles away. So soon as one
  descries food it betrays the fact by its actions, making off in the direction of the prospective
  feast; it is then followed immediately by its yet more distant neighbour, and this by a third, and
  so the first serves as a guide to all the other soaring birds for miles around. This flight has
  been admirably expressed by Longfellow in "Hiawatha."</p>

  <p>We need here mention only one or two of the more important species of vulture, and among these
  one of the most interesting is the <span class="sc">Lammergeir</span>, or <span class="sc">Bearded
  Vulture</span>. This species is one of the least vulture-like of the tribe, not only in general
  appearance, but also in habits, and is to be regarded as near the ancestral stock, whose
  descendants have become more and more addicted to feeding upon dead bodies.</p>

  <p>The lammergeir, or bearded vulture, is a bird of large size and majestic flight, differing from
  all other vultures in that the head and neck are clothed in feathers, whilst the nostrils are
  covered by long bristles. Beneath the bill hangs a tuft of bristles like those covering the
  nostrils; hence its name of Bearded Vulture; and this, coupled with a remarkable red rim to the
  eyes, gives the bird an almost diabolical appearance. It lives partly upon living animals and
  partly upon carrion, bones apparently being especially relished; these it breaks by dropping them
  from a height upon the rocks below, probably to get at the marrow. Land-tortoises are treated in a
  similar manner, and it was possibly this species which caused the death of the poet &AElig;schylus, on
  whose bare head a tortoise is alleged to have been dropped. It was at one time common in Europe,
  and is still fairly numerous in West Africa, though rare in the East and South. Many stories are
  told of its strength and daring, some of which concern the carrying off of young children; but
  these are probably mythical, modern observers generally agreeing that the bird is by nature far
  from courageous.</p>

      <p class="sp0">It is called the Bearded Vulture on account of the tuft of bristles hanging
      from the chin.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The more typical vultures differ from the lammergeir in having the head and neck more or less
  bare, and often conspicuously coloured, or covered with a short velvety down. The <span
  class="sc">Cinereous</span>, <span class="sc">Griffon</span>, <span class="sc">Pondicherry</span>,
  and <span class="sc">Egyptian Vultures</span> may be cited as examples of these.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Cinereous</span> or <span class="sc">Black Vulture</span> is a heavy and
  repulsive-looking bird, feeding entirely on garbage. On the wing, however, this vulture shares
  with its relatives the admiration of all who have been privileged to watch it; sailing in graceful
  circles in the blue sky of the tropics, or hurrying from all quarters of the compass to some
  ghoulish feast, it forms a spectacle, once seen, never to be forgotten. It is found on both sides
  of the Mediterranean, and extends eastwards to India and China.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page471"><span class="smaller">{471}</span></span></div>

  <p>This species, like the <span class="sc">Griffon-vulture</span>, has the head and neck
  down-covered, thus standing in strong contrast with the <span class="sc">Pondicherry</span> and
  <span class="sc">Sacred Vultures</span> of India and Africa, which have bare heads and necks
  ornamented by loose folds or lappets of skin of a pinkish colour. These vultures hunt in pairs,
  and are very self-assertive, driving away all other birds from their prey. They build enormous
  nests of sticks in bushes and trees, thus differing from the vultures previously described, which
  generally nest on ledges of rock on precipitous cliffs. These nests are made of sticks, lined with
  straw and leaves. A single egg is laid, which is white with red markings. The largest species
  rivals the condor in size.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Egyptian Vulture</span>, sometimes known as <span class="sc">Pharaoh's

  of the neck are naked and of a lemon-yellow colour; whilst the feet are pink and the eyes crimson.
  Not only is it a carrion-feeder, but it will also follow the plough, picking up worms and grubs.

  <p>Eagles occur all over the world, save only in New Zealand. An eagle, it is interesting to note,

  numbers, in Scotland. In Ireland it is fast verging on extinction, trap, gun, and poison having
  wrought its destruction. In times past it bred in the Lake District of England. Abroad it is found
  over the greater part of Europe, Northern Asia, India and China, and Northern Africa, and America
  as far south as Mexico. It is a very fierce and powerful bird, attacking such <span
  class="pagenum" id="page472"><span class="smaller">{472}</span></span>large animals as antelopes,
  wolves, and foxes, as well as the more helpless fawns, lambs, hares and rabbits, and ducks, geese,

  <p>Very different from the free-roving golden eagle and its allies is the South American <span

  strength, as the powerful bill and feet testify. Whilst other eagles are conspicuous for their
  powers of flight, the present species is rarely seen on the wing, being strictly a forest-dweller,
  with short wings and tail, and of a somewhat owl-like plumage, the feathers being very soft. At
  rest it is one of the most striking of all the eagles. The head is crested, the under parts of the
  body are white, and the upper dark grey, banded with black. It feeds upon sloths, peccaries, and
  spider-monkeys.</p>

  <p>So recently as 1897 another forest-dwelling species was discovered in the Philippines, and this
  also preys largely upon monkeys. Its nearest ally is apparently the harpy-eagle, and, like this
  species, it is a bird of large size and very powerful. It is further remarkable for the enormous
  size of the beak, which differs from that of all other members of this group in being much
  compressed from side to side.</p>

  <p>The sea, as well as the mountain and the forest, is also, as it were, presided over by members
  of this group, which are in consequence called <span class="sc">Sea-eagles</span>. One species,
  the <span class="sc">White-tailed Eagle</span>, or <span class="sc">Erne</span>, is reckoned among
  British birds, though it is fast verging on extinction. In former days it bred on the sea-cliffs
  of Scotland and Ireland, and in the Lake District. The nest, or eyrie, as it is called, is
  commonly placed on inaccessible cliffs, but sometimes on the ground or in a tree, and, as is usual
  with the group, is made of sticks, with a lining of finer materials. This eagle feeds principally
  upon fish, though hares, lambs, and rabbits and carrion are occasionally taken.</p>

  <p>The Hawk Tribe, generally speaking, have the wings comparatively short, the legs long and
  slender, and the edges of the beak with a sinuous outline and unnotched; but it is impossible to
  sharply define the group. The best-known species are the <span class="sc">Sparrow-</span> and
  <span class="sc">Gos-hawks</span>. The first named is still a common British bird, but the latter
  has now become very <span class="pagenum" id="page473"><span
  class="smaller">{473}</span></span>rare indeed. In both species the male is a much smaller bird
  than the female, and is also more brightly coloured. The <span class="sc">Gos-hawk</span> was at
  one time used in falconry; it is a bird of extremely ferocious disposition, and in the days when
  hawks were used for sporting purposes had to be kept very safely tethered, as, if it gained its
  liberty, it would at once proceed to kill every other hawk and falcon in the "mews."</p>

  Game-birds. The resemblance is evidently advantageous, for thereby the hawk is enabled to sit

  curassow.</p>

  hawks by the fact that the eyes are dark hazel-brown instead of yellow, and that the bare, yellow,
  waxy-looking band of skin at the base of the beak, so characteristic of the Birds of Prey, is not
  sharply defined, but scantily clothed with fine bristles, passing insensibly into the feathers of
  the crown of the head.</p>

  <p>Some of the best-known members of this section of the group are the <span
  class="sc">Peregrine</span> and <span class="sc">Jer-falcons</span>, and the <span
  class="sc">Kestrel</span>, <span class="sc">Hobby</span>, and <span class="sc">Merlin</span>. Only
  the peregrine and the kestrel, however, can now be called common.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Peregrine</span> is the falcon held so much in esteem by falconers, by
  whom the female only was called the "falcon," the male, which is smaller, being known as a
  "tiercel." The female was used for the capture of the larger game, such as herons and rooks;
  whilst the male was flown only at partridges, and sometimes magpies.</p>

  <p>In a wild state the peregrine falcon is regarded by other birds with the greatest fear and
  terror. Ducks feeding on the banks of streams or lakes, on perceiving it, immediately take to the
  water; whilst plovers and lapwings rise to an immense height in the air, and remain there for
  hours. Mr. Ussher, who has had many opportunities of studying this bird in Ireland, where it is
  quite common, relates an instance of the tenacity with which it follows its prey, in this case a
  lapwing. "The falcon," he says, "after several stoops, cleverly avoided by the lapwing, was so
  near clutching, that the poor bird, quite worn out, dropped into the water, and the falcon, after
  rising from her stoop, poised a moment on her wings, and then quietly lowering herself with
  extended legs, lifted the lapwing from the water and bore her off."</p>

  <p>The eyrie is generally found half-way up some precipitous cliff: no nest is made, but the eggs
  are laid on the earth or gravel covering the selected ledge. When eggs are found in a nest, the
  latter has always been taken from some other bird, even the eagle being occasionally dispossessed.
  Three or four eggs are laid, which are very beautiful and variable in their coloration. The young
  are attended by their parents long after they are able to fly.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Jer-falcons</span> are birds of large size and great beauty, and at one
  time were much in request by falconers, probably largely on account of their appearance, for they
  lack the power and spirit of the peregrine. Grey and black and white and black are distinctive
  colours of the various species, which are inhabitants of northern regions.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Kestrel</span>, or <span class="sc">Wind-hover</span>, is one of the
  commonest birds of prey, much and most unjustly persecuted by gamekeepers. In its general
  appearance it closely resembles its much smaller relative, the so-called "<span
  class="sc">Sparrow-hawk</span>" of America, shown in the photograph on this page by Dr. Shufeldt.
  The American sparrow-hawk, it should be mentioned, is really a species of kestrel, and, like the
  British kestrel, belongs to the Falcon group of the Birds of Prey. Like the peregrine falcon, the
  kestrel does not build a nest, but takes possession of the deserted nests of crows and magpies, or
  deposits its eggs on the bare earth of a recess in some cliff or quarry which is overhung by a
  projecting shelf of rock. Occasionally a hole in a tree is chosen, the eggs then resting on the
  rotten wood at the bottom. That the kestrel is of a more confiding disposition than the majority
  of its tribe seems to be proved by the fact that it will often deposit its eggs in nesting-boxes,
  if these are placed in suitable spots. On some English estates the harmlessness of this bird is
  fully recognised, and every encouragement is given it to breed by the erection of these
  nesting-boxes. By way of illustration we may cite a case where, on an estate in Kent in 1900, five
  of these boxes were erected 20 or 30 feet from the ground round a single field, all of which were
  tenanted by kestrels; and though a thousand young pheasants were reared in this field, not a
  single one of these was missed by the keepers. Besides its human enemies, the kestrel has to
  contend with crows and rooks, which spare no efforts to seize its eggs whenever the opportunity
  presents itself. The eggs, it should be mentioned, are of a bright ruddy colour, but, like those
  of the peregrine falcon, lose much of their freshness of colouring during incubation. Four or five
  in number, they are laid at intervals of two days or so, incubation commencing with the deposition
  of the first egg; as a result, the first nestling hatched may be more than a week older than the
  last.</p>

  <p>The food of the kestrel appears to consist mainly of mice, but frogs, earthworms, grasshoppers,
  cockchafers, and other beetles are also taken. Kestrels will also eat dead animals, as is proved
  by the fact that they are not seldom found dead from eating poisoned rats laid out for magpies.
  One instance is on record where a kestrel was taken with its claws entangled in the fur of a
  stoat, which fiercely defended itself. It is an easy matter, for those who will take the trouble,
  to find out what is the staple diet of the kestrel; for if the nest and its neighbourhood be
  searched, numerous small rounded pellets of the size of a chestnut will be found, which, when
  broken up, will prove to be composed of the hard and indigestible parts of what has been
  swallowed. The majority of such pellets are made up of the fur and bones of mice.</p>

  <p>The little <span class="sc">American "Sparrow-hawk,"</span> which, as we have already pointed
  out, is really a species of kestrel, appears to be almost exclusively insectivorous during the
  summer months, preying mainly upon grasshoppers. An American ornithologist, Mr. Henshaw, writing
  on the subject, remarks that during a scourge of grasshoppers the sparrow-hawks assembled in
  hundreds; and although on this occasion, owing to the vast myriads in which these insects had
  collected, the birds could make no visible impression, yet <span class="pagenum"
  id="page477"><span class="smaller">{477}</span></span>they must have done an immense amount of
  good. Ornithologists from all parts of the United States unanimously agree that grasshoppers form
  the staple diet of this hawk, though mice and gophers are also largely eaten, and especially
  during the winter months, when insect food is scarce.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Of the <span class="sc">Pygmy Falcons</span> there are several species, ranging
  from the Eastern Himalaya, through Tenasserim and Burma, to the Malay Islands and the Philippines.
  The smallest is the <span class="sc">Red-legged Falconet</span> of Nepal, Sikhim, and Burma. It
  feeds largely upon insects, such as dragon-flies, beetles, and butterflies, hawking them with a
  swallow-like speed. Occasionally the members of this little group are said to hunt down and kill
  birds larger than themselves.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="fine">OWLS.</span></p>

  <p>Few birds have been more misrepresented in literature than the Owls. For centuries they have
  been depicted as birds of ill omen, and accused of all kinds of diabolical practices. Shakespeare,
  for example, repeatedly makes the owl do duty for some evil sign, or fulfil some dire purpose.
  Thus in <i>Macbeth</i>, Act II., Scene ii.,</p>

  <div class="poem poemc21">
    <p>It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,</p>
    <p>Which gives the stern'st good-night.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And later on, in Act IV., it is an owl's wing which he makes the witches add to their caldron
  of noisome things, when brewing their deadly potion. In Spain the scops and tawny owls are
  believed to be devil's birds, and are accused of drinking the oil from the lamps suspended before
  the shrines of saints. The gamekeeper nails their bodies up on the barn door as offenders of the
  worst type, whilst the Malagasy believe owls to be the embodiments of evil spirits.</p>

  <p>It is therefore a relief to find this unwarrantable prejudice is not absolutely universal,
  since amongst some people, at least, the owl has found some favour. The best-known instance of
  this is the <span class="pagenum" id="page478"><span class="smaller">{478}</span></span>case of
  the Greeks, who made the owl the symbol of wisdom, and chose as an emblem, singularly enough, the
  species known as the Little Owl, a bird which is notorious for its ludicrous behaviour, so much so
  that it has earned for itself the reputation of being the veritable buffoon of birds. Its
  grotesque and ridiculous antics are utilised by Continental bird-catchers, who use it as a lure to
  attract small birds, tethering it for this purpose near nets, snares, or twigs smeared with
  bird-lime.</p>

  <p>Amongst other birds, strangely enough, the owl appears to be as much disliked as the fiercer
  and more dangerous members of the Hawk Tribe, and in consequence, should one venture abroad during
  the day or be discovered in its retreat, the alarm is given, and every small bird within call is
  summoned to take part in a general mobbing.</p>

  <p>Although proverbially unpalatable, the Little Owl is said to be eaten in Italy, as are other
  species in the various countries in which they are found.</p>

  <p>Varying considerably in size, the owls, nevertheless, present a very general uniformity in
  appearance. All are remarkable for the peculiar softness of their plumage, which imparts to the
  wings the almost unique power of absolutely silent flight, the sound being deadened or muffled, so
  that the prey can be approached suddenly, and seized before escape is possible. This is very
  necessary when hunting in twilight hours. The owls are almost the only birds in which the outer
  toe is reversible, or capable of being turned either forwards or backwards. Furthermore, the
  members of this group are remarkable for the fact that the eyes look directly forward, instead of
  outwards, as in other birds, and that the feathers of the face are arranged round each eye in the
  form of a disk, and thus impart the familiar owl-like visage, seen elsewhere only among certain of
  the Hawk Tribe known as "Harriers."</p>

  <p>Four species of owl are to be found sparsely distributed over Great Britain. We may regard as
  the typical owl the species known as the <span class="sc">Tawny</span> or <span
  class="sc">Wood-owl</span>. It is the largest of the resident owls in England, and would be much
  more abundant but that it is subjected to a rigorous and foolish persecution, born of
  long-standing prejudice and ignorance; it stands accused of the heinous offence of eating game, a
  charge which has never yet been fully proved. The benefits it confers are great, but,
  unfortunately, unrecognised, for its chief food consists of rats and mice. This is the bird which
  gives utterance to that weird "hoo-hoo&mdash;hoo-hoo-hoo," <span class="pagenum"
  id="page479"><span class="smaller">{479}</span></span>one of the most charming of the many
  delightful sounds that break the stillness of the summer nights. It is interesting to note that
  this species is unknown as a wild bird in Ireland.</p>

      <p class="sp0">This is a young bird which has not yet completely lost its down-feathers.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Other and fairly common species in England are the <span class="sc">Long-</span> and <span
  class="sc">Short-eared Owls</span>, both remarkable for the fact that the aperture of the ear,
  which is of enormous size, is of a different shape on the right and left sides of the head. These
  owls, furthermore, are characterised by the possession of a pair of feathery tufts, or "horns,"
  springing from the top of the head, which can be erected or depressed at pleasure. These horns are
  found in many species of owl not necessarily closely related. The species under consideration are
  of medium size, with large eyes of a most wonderful golden-yellow colour, standing in strong
  contrast with those of the tawny owl, which are nearly black. Like the tawny owl, these two
  species, and especially the short-eared, live largely on rats and mice. The last-named bird also
  devours great numbers of dor-beetles and cockchafers.</p>

  <p>Amongst the largest of the tribe are the <span class="sc">Eagle-</span> and <span
  class="sc">Snowy Owls</span>, both of which are occasionally met with in Great Britain. The
  eagle-owl may be described as a largely magnified long-eared owl in general appearance, though, as
  a matter of fact, the two are not very closely related. The snowy owl, as its name implies, is
  white in colour, the white being relieved by more or less conspicuous black markings. This white
  livery, assimilating with its snowy surroundings, allows the wearer to approach its prey
  unperceived on the snow. Whilst the snowy owl is confined to northern regions, the eagle-owl
  enjoys a wide distribution, and is represented by numerous species, one of which, as we have
  remarked, occasionally visits Great Britain. The larger species of eagle-owl are the most
  ferocious members of the order, and prey largely upon hares, rabbits, and the large game-birds;
  whilst the snowy owl, though selecting similar prey, does incalculable good by devouring those
  destructive little rodents known as the lemmings.</p>

  <p>Solitary as owls usually are, some, as the <span class="sc">American Burrowing-owls</span>,
  live in what may be called colonies; and, stranger still, they live in burrows, which they share
  with the original excavators. Occurring both in North and South America, it is not surprising to
  find that the creatures with whom the burrowing-owls elect to take up their abode are very varied,
  belonging for the most part to numerous groups of burrowing mammalia. In the prairies of North
  <span class="pagenum" id="page480"><span class="smaller">{480}</span></span>America they appear to
  quarter themselves upon the prairie-dogs, ground-squirrels, and badgers; and in the pampas of
  South America upon the Patagonian cavy, the viscacha and armadillos, and occasionally lizards. It
  seems to be no unusual thing to find, in addition to the bird and mammal tenants of a single
  burrow, one or more full-grown examples of the much-dreaded rattle-snake&mdash;a truly wonderful
  happy-family, if all accounts are to be believed. But many competent to speak on the matter throw
  out dark hints which would appear to show that the owl quarters itself on the tenants of a burrow
  too weak to resist its intrusion upon their domicile, and that occasionally this most masterful
  bird renders itself still more objectionable by devouring the progeny of its hosts, and sometimes
  even the hosts themselves.</p>

  <p>The species known as <span class="sc">Pygmy Owls</span> and <span class="sc">Little Owls</span>
  we mention here only on account of their small size, one member of the former group being little
  bigger than a lark. Thus they stand in strong contrast with the giant snowy and eagle-owls.</p>

  <p>Finally, we have the <span class="sc">White</span> or <span class="sc">Barn-owl</span>, which
  with its allies forms a group distinguished from all the other owls by certain well-marked
  structural characters. The barn-owl is also to be found in Great Britain, but is growing, like all
  the other owls in this area, more and more rare every year, owing to persecution at the hands of
  gamekeepers. It is a handsome bird, of a pale buff-yellow, mottled with grey above to pure white
  beneath, and with the characteristic facial disk peculiarly well developed. It breeds in holes in
  trees, ruins, and church towers, and feeds almost entirely on mice and rats. From the piercing

  <p>It is probable that the <span class="sc">Night-jars</span> are the nearest allies of the Owls.
  As pointed out in the last chapter, although the latter have acquired the habits of the Hawk and
  Eagle Tribe, they are not really connected with that group by descent.</p>

  <p>Soberly clad, so as to be in complete harmony with its surroundings, with large eyes, huge
  mouth, and peculiarly short beak, beset with long bristles, the night-jar may be distinguished at
  once from all other British birds. By day it hides, squatting close to the ground, or perched on
  the thick branch of a tree; but when on the latter, it sits along and not across the bough, like
  other birds, the complete harmony between its plumage and the bark rendering it as invisible as
  when on the ground.</p>

      resemblance to the waving grass in which the bird nests afford protection.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Not until the spring has far advanced does this bird leave its winter resort in Africa for
  Europe, making its presence known by its conspicuous habit of hunting its food (which consists of
  moths and beetles) after twilight has fallen. Later, its extraordinary churring note is <span
  class="pagenum" id="page482"><span class="smaller">{482}</span></span>heard&mdash;a note which has
  been likened to the noise made by a spinning-wheel, and so powerful as to be audible half a mile
  off. This note is made while on the ground: on the wing, while toying with its mate, another
  equally peculiar sound is made, which has been likened to the noise made by swinging a whip-thong
  through the air.</p>

  <p>No nest is made by this bird; but the eggs, two in number and beautifully marked, are laid on
  the bare ground. The young are covered with down, and remain in the nest for some time.</p>

  <p>Another very remarkable feature is the fact that the claw of the middle toe has its inner edge
  curiously serrated, forming a sort of comb, the function of which is unknown. This comb-like claw
  occurs also in some few other birds&mdash;bitterns, for instance.</p>

  <p>A very remarkable kind is the <span class="sc">Pennant-winged Night-jar</span>, in which one of
  the quill-feathers in each wing is produced into a "pennant" of some 17 inches in length. The
  shaft of the feather is bare for the greater part of its length, and terminates in a feathery
  blade. It is an Abyssinian species about which not much is known.</p>

  <p>Some of the night-jars, as the New World <span class="sc">Night-hawk</span> and the Old World
  <span class="sc">Eared Night-jars</span>, are particularly owl-like, a resemblance imparted by
  long "ear-like" tufts of feathers which rise from the back of the head. Others, as the <span
  class="sc">More-pork</span> of the Tasmanian colonist, or the <span class="sc">Frog-mouth</span>,
  as it is called in Australia, are remarkable for the huge size of the mouth, bounded, as it
  appears to be, by huge lips, represented by the short, round-edged beak.</p>

  <p>Very nearly related to the night-jars is the <span class="sc">Oil-bird</span> of South America,
  which lives in caves in Trinidad, Ecuador, and Peru, where it builds a nest which has been likened
  in appearance to a huge cheese, and in which are laid from two to four white eggs. Like the
  night-jars, these birds feed by night, emerging from their gloomy retreats at twilight with much
  noise and in great numbers. Their food, however, is entirely of a vegetable nature, consisting of
  oily nuts or fruits.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The young, soon after they are hatched, become perfect masses of fat, and on this
  account are much in demand by the Indians, who make a special business of killing them and
  extracting the oil.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Swifts.</span></p>

  <p>In general appearance <span class="sc">Swifts</span> bear a strong superficial resemblance to
  Swallows; in reality they are related, not to those harbingers of spring, but to the Night-jars on
  the one hand and the Humming-birds on the other.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Common Swift</span> arrives in England during the early part of May, and
  stays till the end of August, or sometimes till September has half run its course. Black in
  colour, relieved only by a white throat, it has little in the sense of beauty to recommend it;
  nevertheless, there are probably few who do not cherish tender feelings towards this bird. The
  swift has great buoyancy of spirits, as is manifested by the wild, exuberant bursts of screaming
  to which it gives voice as it rushes in small parties down the lanes or along the less-frequented
  thoroughfares of towns as morning breaks or evening falls, and occasionally throughout the day.
  The greater part of its life is spent upon the wing (indeed, it appears to rest only when
  incubating or sleeping), and of all the smaller birds it is the most graceful in flight, turning
  and twisting in fairy mazes high in the heavens for hours at a time.</p>

      <p class="sp3">SWIFT.</p>
      <p class="sp0">A common British bird during the summer months.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The swift chooses for its nesting-place the eaves of houses and holes in church towers, and
  occasionally a crevice in the face of a quarry. The nest is formed of bits of straw, dry grass,
  and a few feathers, glued together by a secretion of the salivary glands into a compact crust; in
  this the bird deposits from two to four white eggs. The young, which are hatched naked and blind,
  never develop down-feathers, but soon become more or less imperfectly clothed in a mass of tiny
  spines, representing the budding feathers; these give the bird somewhat the appearance of a young
  hedgehog.</p>

  <p>In adaptation to its remarkable powers of flight, the wing has undergone considerable
  modification in form, so that it differs from that of all other birds. On the other hand, the
  legs, being so little required, have diminished considerably, and are remarkable for their
  smallness&mdash;a fact which hampers the bird considerably, should it happen to alight on level
  ground, for, owing to the great length of the wings, it can arise only with considerable
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>Nearly allied to the common swift is <span class="sc">Salvin's Swift</span>, remarkable on
  account of its nest, which has been described by Dr. Sharpe as the most wonderful in the world.
  About 2 feet long and 6 inches in diameter, it looks rather like the sleeve of an old coat than a
  nest. It is made entirely of the downy seeds of plants, which, floating through the air after the
  fashion of such seeds, are caught by the birds when on the wing, and, partly felted and partly
  glued by the salivary secretion, are woven slowly into the characteristic woolly domicile. The
  site and manner of fixation of the nest are scarcely less wonderful, for it is suspended from the
  flat surface of some projecting piece of rock on the face of a cliff, and is thus almost
  inaccessible; yet, as if to make assurance doubly sure, two entrances are made, one at <span
  class="pagenum" id="page485"><span class="smaller">{485}</span></span>the bottom, which is really
  blind, and one at the top, near its foundation, if we may call it so, which leads into the
  nursery.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The nests of this bird are used for soup; five are seen in this photograph.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Still more swallow-like in general appearance are the diminutive <span class="sc">Edible
  Swifts</span>, so called, not on account of the palatability of the birds themselves, but of their
  nests, which are in great demand by the wealthy Chinese for conversion into birds'-nest soup. It
  has already been remarked that the salivary glands are unusually active in the swifts, their
  secretion bearing a very important part in the construction of the nest, and serving as a kind of
  cement. It is, therefore, not surprising that in some members of the group we find this secretion
  playing a still more prominent part, forming, at least in one species, the entire material of the
  nest. "With these nests," writes Dr. Sharpe, "a large trade is done with China from many of the
  Malayan Islands, over 3,500,000 nests having been known to be exported in a single year from
  Borneo to the latter country.... In Borneo and other places the caves in which the swiftlets build
  are leased to the collectors for a considerable sum; but it is only the white nests, made of the
  pure secretion, which are of any real value. The nests of those species which mix into their nests
  grass or feathers are not appreciated as an article of commerce."</p>

  <p class="sp3">Colonel Legge gives some extremely interesting particulars concerning the nesting
  habits of these birds in Ceylon. "It is noteworthy," he writes, "that the partially fledged
  young&mdash;which were procured on this occasion for me, and which I kept for the
  night&mdash;scrambled out on to the exterior of the nest, and slept in an upright position, with
  the bill pointing straight up. This is evidently the normal mode of roosting resorted to by this
  species. The interior of this cave, with its numbers of active tenants, presented a singular
  appearance. The bottom was filled with a vast deposit of liquid guano, reaching, I was informed,
  to a depth of 30 feet, and composed of droppings, old nests, and dead young fallen from above, the
  whole mingled into a loathsome mass, with water lodged in the crevices, and causing an awful
  stench, which would have been intolerable for a moment even, had not the hundreds of frightened
  little birds, as they screamed and whirred in and out of the gloomy cave with a hum like a storm
  in a ship's rigging, powerfully excited my interest, and produced a long examination of the
  colony. This guano-deposit is a source of considerable profit to the estate, the hospitable
  manager of which informed us that he had manured 100 acres of coffee with it during that
  season."</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Humming-birds.</span></p>

  <p>It is generally admitted that <span class="sc">Humming-birds</span> are nearly related to
  Swifts, with which, however, they stand in the strongest possible contrast in the matter of
  plumage&mdash;the latter being always inconspicuously coloured, whilst the former are for the most
  part clad in vestments so gorgeous as to render it extremely difficult to describe them in sober
  language. Moreover, so great is the wealth of species&mdash;some hundreds in number&mdash;and so
  varied are the form and coloration, and so closely do the various types pass one into the other,
  that their classification is a matter of extreme difficulty.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page486"><span class="smaller">{486}</span></span></div>

  <p>Confined to the American Continent and certain islands adjacent thereto, humming-birds range
  from Canada to Tierra del Fuego in a horizontal direction, and rise vertically in the
  mountain-range of Chimborazo to a height of 16,000 feet above the sea-level&mdash;"dwelling," as
  Professor Newton describes it, "in a world of almost constant hail, sleet, and rain, and feeding
  on the insects which resort to the indigenous flowering plants."</p>

      <p class="sp3">RUBY-THROATED HUMMING-BIRDS.</p>
      <p class="sp0">About 500 distinct species of humming-birds are known.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Humming-birds surpass all others in the wondrous beauty of their plumage, which depends not so
  much on colour as metallic lustre reflecting all the hues of the most precious
  stones&mdash;amethyst, ruby, sapphire, emerald, and topaz gleaming and sparkling from their bodies
  with a fire and intensity truly marvellous. "In some cases," as Professor Newton aptly describes
  it, "this radiance beams from the brow, in some it glows from the throat, in others it shines from
  the tail-coverts, in others it sparkles from the tips of elongated feathers that crest the head or
  surround the neck as with a frill, while again in others it may appear as a luminous streak across
  the cheek.... The feathers that cover the upper parts of the body very frequently have a metallic
  lustre of golden green, which in other birds would be thought sufficiently beautiful, but in the
  [humming-birds] its sheen is overspread by the almost dazzling splendour that radiates from the
  spots where Nature's lapidary has set her jewels."</p>

  <p>Besides this brilliancy of colour and variety in form&mdash;variety due to the development of
  these crests and frills, or to the forking and elongation of the tail-feathers&mdash;still further
  changes are brought about by the modification of the bill, which may be produced into a long
  straight style, longer than the body of the bird, or turned up like that of the avocet or down
  like that of the curlew. These changes are adaptations to the bird's methods of feeding, some
  seeking their food from the long tubular corollas of flowers, and requiring, therefore, very
  elongated beaks, others from more open and easily accessible flowers, whilst others hunt among
  leaves, especially the under-surfaces, the quarry consisting mainly of insects attracted by the
  honey secreted by the flowers, or those living on the leaves. Not only the beak but the tongue
  also has undergone great modification in this group, its outer sheath curling up on each side into
  a thin scroll, so as to form a pair of tubes, the exact use of which is unknown. The wings, like
  those of the swift, have undergone a certain amount of change in the relative proportion of the
  several regions, and in the form and number of the quill-feathers, whilst the legs have become
  considerably reduced in size. In some species each leg is surrounded by a little tuft of down,
  which may be black, brown, or snow-white in colour. In size these birds vary from 8 inches to
  scarcely more than 3 inches.</p>

  <p class="sp5">"The beautiful nests of humming-birds," writes Professor Newton, "than which the
  fairies could not have conceived more delicate ... will be found on examination to be very solidly
  and tenaciously built, though the materials are generally of the slightest&mdash;cotton-wool, or
  some vegetable down, and spiders' webs. They vary greatly in form and ornamentation&mdash;for it
  would seem that the portions of lichen which frequently bestud them are affixed to their exterior
  with that object, though probably concealment was the original intention. They are mostly
  cup-shaped; and the singular fact is on record, that in one instance, as the young grew, the walls
  were heightened by the parents, until at last the nest was more than twice as big as when the eggs
  were laid and hatched."</p>

  <p>"The art of taming wild animals," writes Mr. Jenks in his "History of Politics," "and making

  earliest domesticated animals were pets. How great a share, then, <span class="sc">Parrots</span>

  <p>Of the first named, the best known is the <span class="sc">Kea</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Mountain-nestor</span>, of the South Island, New Zealand. Dull in coloration, and not
  striking in appearance, it has earned an unenviable notoriety, which appears to rest as much upon
  fable as upon fact. It seems that, since the introduction of sheep into this part of the world by
  the settlers, this bird has found a diet of flesh more stimulating than one of fruit. Exactly how
  this came to be is not known. Two explanations have been advanced. The first has it that the birds
  settled on the skins of the sheep slaughtered for their wool, and picked off pieces of fat
  therefrom, as well as various tit-bits from the carcases of the same, and thus found out how
  toothsome&mdash;or beaksome&mdash;mutton was. From this they went a step further, and did the
  slaughtering for themselves. Parties of them now go a-hunting, worry a sheep till exhausted, then
  dig down through the back, and so wound the intestines that death results. Another explanation is
  that the birds in the original instance mistook the sheep's backs for the huge masses of lichen
  common to this region, of which the birds are very fond. Not finding it to their taste at the top,
  they dug deep, and soon came to the flesh, which, like the forbidden fruit, proved more palatable
  than that which was provided for them by a bountiful Nature. The result is, that they have become
  a menace to sheep-farmers, and are on this account in danger of extermination. It has, however,
  been denied recently that the damage inflicted is anything like so serious as was at one time
  reported, since on one run, where the damage was unusually large, only 1 in 300 sheep was so
  attacked. This bird has also been said to attack horses.</p>

  <p>Very different, in general appearance and in esteem, are the <span class="sc">Lories</span>.
  Like the Nestors, the tip of the upper jaw, or beak, is smooth, or nearly so; and in this respect
  these two groups are to be distinguished from all the other parrots; but in the gorgeousness of
  their plumage they far eclipse their congeners. Absent in New Zealand, they are found elsewhere
  <span class="pagenum" id="page489"><span class="smaller">{489}</span></span>throughout the
  Australasian region, inclusive of Polynesia, and are highly esteemed as pets, combining great
  beauty with a very docile disposition and considerable talking powers.</p>

  <p>The birds of this section are also known as <span class="sc">Brush-tongued Parrots</span>, from
  the presence of a remarkable "brush" borne on the end of the tongue. This is a special adaptation,
  enabling the birds to feed upon honey; some, indeed, have this brush particularly well developed,
  and are almost entirely honey-seekers, whilst others, wherein the brush is less developed, live
  largely on fruits. Professor Moseley tells us that honey literally poured from the mouths of <span
  class="sc">Blue Mountain-lories</span> which he shot at Cape York.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Cockatoos</span> are abundant in the Australian region, but have their
  headquarters in the Malay Archipelago. Besides the familiar white-crested form so commonly kept in
  England, the group includes an iron-grey coloured bird with a bright red head, and a huge black
  species, which represents the giant of the order. It is a funereal-looking bird, the largest
  specimens inhabiting New Guinea. One of its most striking features is the beak, which is of
  enormous size. Its tongue differs from that of other parrots in that it is slender and cylindrical
  in shape, and of a deep red colour, instead of thick, fleshy, and black. It frequents, Mr. Wallace
  tells us, the lower parts of the forest, feeding upon various fruits and seeds, but displaying a
  marked partiality for the kernel of the canary-nut, which grows on a lofty forest-tree; "and the
  manner in which it gets at these seeds," writes Mr. Wallace, "shows a correlation of structure and
  habits which would point to the canary as its special food. The shell of this nut is so
  excessively hard that only a heavy hammer will crack it; it is somewhat triangular, and the
  outside is quite smooth. The manner in which the bird opens these nuts is very curious. Taking one
  end-ways in its bill, and keeping it firm by a pressure of the tongue, it cuts a transverse notch
  by a lateral sawing motion of the sharp-edged lower mandible. This done, it takes hold of the nut
  with its foot, and, biting off a piece of leaf, retains it in the deep notch by the upper
  mandible, and again seizing the nut, which is prevented from slipping by the elastic tissue of the
  leaf, fixes the edge of the lower mandible in the notch, and a powerful rip breaks off a piece of
  the shell. Again taking the nut in its claws, it inserts the very long and sharp point of the
  bill, and picks out the kernel, which is seized hold of, morsel by morsel, by the extensile
  tongue."</p>

  <p>Of the typical parrots, the best known is the common <span class="sc">Grey African
  Parrot</span>, with a red tail, so valued on account of its great talking powers. Other species of
  this section which should be mentioned here are the <span class="sc">Pygmy Parrots</span>, <span
  class="sc">Macaws</span>, <span class="sc">Hawk-billed Parrot</span>, <span
  class="sc">Budgerigars</span>, and <span class="sc">Owl-parrot</span>.</p>

  <p>The first named are the smallest of all the tribe, remarkable as well for the splendour of the
  plumage as their size, which is less than that of the common sparrow.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Long-tailed Macaws</span>, representing the most showy and gaudily
  coloured of all the Parrot Tribe, inhabit the tropical forests of South America. Mr. Bates
  describes a flock of scarlet-and-blue macaws, which he came across one day, as looking like a
  cluster of flaunting banners among the crown of dark green leaves of a bacaba-palm.</p>

  <p>The superb <span class="sc">Hyacinthine Macaw</span> is one of the rarest of the Parrot Tribe,
  and was found <span class="pagenum" id="page490"><span class="smaller">{490}</span></span>by Bates
  in the interior of Brazil. As its name implies, it is of a deep hyacinthine colour, relieved by a
  bare patch of pure white skin round the eyes. It feeds on the nuts of several palms, especially
  those of the macuja. These nuts, which are so hard as to be difficult to break without a heavy
  hammer, are crushed to a pulp by the powerful beak of this macaw.</p>

  <p>Crests among parrots are common enough, but only one species wears a frill; this is the <span
  class="sc">Hawk-billed Parrot</span> of the Amazon Valley. It is closely related to the large and
  well-known <span class="sc">Amazon Parrots</span>, and has been aptly described as a most
  extraordinary bird. Its coloration is striking&mdash;green above, with a brown head; the frill or
  ruff around the neck shows up in strong contrast, being dark red, with blue edges, and barred with
  blue. The feathers of the breast and abdomen, like the frill, are also red and blue, whilst the
  under-surfaces of the tail and wings are black. It is only when the bird is excited or angry that
  the ruff is raised.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Hanging-parrots</span> are about the same size as the well-known
  "love-birds," and remarkable for their habit of sleeping suspended head-downwards by one foot from

  <p>The Australian <span class="sc">Budgerigars</span>, or <span

  class="sc">Long-tailed Ground-parrakeet</span>. As its <span class="pagenum" id="page491"><span

  accordance with this habit, has considerably longer legs than the tree-haunting species. This

  <p>The most interesting, perhaps, of all the parrots is the remarkable <span
  class="sc">Kakapo</span>, or <span class="sc">Owl-parrot</span>, of New Zealand. Like the species
  just described, it is also a ground-dweller; furthermore, it differs from all other members of the
  tribe in being flightless, and, like the flightless members of the Ostrich Tribe, has completely
  lost the deep keel from the breast-bone, which gives support to the muscles which move the wings.
  It is a large bird, green in colour, mottled with yellow and black, and derives its name of
  Owl-parrot from the fact that the feathers of the face radiate from the eye outwards to form a
  kind of disk. When eating grass, it is said to graze, nibbling after the fashion of a rabbit.
  Occasionally it is said to climb trees, descending with extended wings, so as to break the force
  of its career. It has been described as a playful and affectionate pet in captivity, displaying
  also great cleverness and intelligence. Unfortunately it is growing more and more rare, so that
  its final extermination is only a question of time&mdash;the ravages of dogs, cats, and pigs,
  introduced by the settlers, being mainly the agents of destruction.</p>

  <p>Once common all over New Zealand, the range of the owl-parrot is now restricted to the
  mountainous regions of North Island and the northern half of South Island. During the day it
  remains concealed in the holes in rocks or under roots of trees, and if disturbed is difficult to
  rouse. When taken from its retreat, it runs swiftly, and tries to hide, seeking shelter, if
  possible, under a heap of soft, dry grass. At sunset, however, it becomes very animated, and
  travels&mdash;at least when possible&mdash;in companies, making tracks a foot or more wide across
  the herbage. It feeds greedily upon mosses, ferns, seeds, berries, and, it is said, even lizards,
  giving vent, when devouring some favourite morsel, to a kind of grunting noise.</p>

  aided by dogs, which, it is said, are not seldom seriously wounded by the powerful bill.</p>

  <p class="sp3">When the breeding-season is over, these birds appear to live in small communities,
  four or five occupying the same hole. They are apparently gifted with some foresight, inasmuch as
  they lay up a store of food, to be drawn upon during bad weather.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Cuckoos and Plantain-eaters.</span></p>

  <p>The Cuckoo Tribe is somewhat unfortunate in that the numerous members of which it is composed
  are completely overshadowed by the prominence which has been given to the <span class="sc">Common
  Cuckoo</span>. Few birds, indeed, have managed to secure so much attention, the poet in particular
  having sung its praises without stint. This enthusiasm undoubtedly is but an echo of the general
  popular sentiment, for there are few birds to which we in Britain extend a more hearty welcome,
  its well-known cry possessing a peculiar charm for lovers of the country. Coming to us in April,
  and leaving again in July, its stay is of the shortest; but during the greater part of this time
  its whereabouts may generally be known by the familiar call "cuckoo, cuckoo," though undergoing
  certain characteristic changes as the months glide by.</p>

  <p>Apart from its song, one of the most interesting things concerning the cuckoo is the fact that
  it goes about in disguise&mdash;the disguise of the ass in the lion's skin with a vengeance; for
  it is clothed in the garb of that terror of the countryside, the sparrow-hawk. Nay, more; it has
  also most successfully imitated the flight of that bogy; and this to frighten little
  birds&mdash;not, however, for the mere purpose of creating consternation amongst them, but for far
  more sinister ends.</p>

  <p>Somehow or another, in cuckoo society, the rearing of a family is a responsibility which is
  utterly repudiated. Great pains seem to have been taken to evade this duty, and yet to ensure the
  continuity of their distinguished house. The oviparous method of reproduction, which obtains in
  the feathered world, has been turned to good account&mdash;in fact, everything depends upon this.
  It seems to have suggested itself as far more convenient to drop an egg here and there into a
  neighbour's nursery, and leave the work of bringing it to life to the owners thereof. But to carry
  out this system of distributing foundlings requires tact, cunning, and the mutual co-operation of
  both the male and his&mdash;at least temporary&mdash;wife; hence the disguise. The plan of
  execution very frequently adopted is for the male to hover over the treasure-house of the intended
  foster-parents hawk-wise. This is sure to call forth an attack from the poor little wretches
  threatened, which ends in an apparently hasty retreat of the marauder, followed by his fearless
  assailants. No sooner is the coast clear, however, than the wily female, taking her egg in her
  beak, slips quietly up to the nest and deposits her burden.</p>

      <p class="sp3">YOUNG CUCKOO EJECTING EGG.</p>
      <p class="sp0">The egg is held in position by the head and wings.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Let us imagine that this home so lately threatened is that of the modest little hedge-sparrow,
  and take a peep during the absence of the owners, after quiet has established itself once again.
  Lying side by side with the tiny sky-blue eggs of the hedge-sparrow we should find the relatively
  large, greyish-green or reddish-grey egg of the cuckoo. What a contrast! If the hedge-sparrows
  notice this too, they evidently do not mind, for they invariably hatch it with their own.</p>

  <p>But some birds are not so accommodating as this, and would ruthlessly destroy or reject any egg
  surreptitiously introduced into the nest. Consequently more deception has to be practised. The
  hawk-like garb still serves its purpose to draw off the intended dupes from the nest; but this is
  not enough, for to deposit an egg of the normal cuckoo type would be worse than useless, since it
  would meet with instant destruction on the return of the owners of the nest. But the cuckoo,
  strange to say, has proved equal to the occasion, and meets the difficulty by laying an egg to
  match those in the nest. The Redstart, Wagtail, Sedge-warbler, Red-backed Shrike, and Meadow-pipit
  may be cited as instances of&mdash;shall we say exclusive?&mdash;birds which must be circumvented
  by "colourable imitations." Perhaps the most wonderful of the cuckoo successes in this direction
  is the imitation of the redstart's egg, which is blue.</p>

  <p>Naturally these facts have given rise to much speculation, but even now we cannot regard the
  discussion as finally settled. Some ornithologists held that the egg of every individual cuckoo
  was subject to great variations, and that the place of deposit of each egg was determined <span
  class="pagenum" id="page495"><span class="smaller">{495}</span></span>only after the bird had
  ascertained its colour. If this were true, surely we should find blue cuckoos' eggs in
  hedge-sparrows' as well as redstarts' nests. But we don't! Others have sought to explain the
  existence of mimicking eggs to the influence of the food peculiar to the foster-parent upon the
  germ of the young female cuckoo, which, through this channel, became transmitted to all its
  descendants. To support this hypothesis it was necessary to throw overboard the old individual
  variability explanation, and to adopt one that is certainly nearer the truth&mdash;to wit, that
  each cuckoo chooses the nest of that species in which itself was reared as a depository, in turn,
  for its own egg, and only when such is not available will it select some other species, and trust
  to luck for its adoption. This would certainly account for many anomalies; but as it seems that
  there are more eggs unlike than like those of the selected foster-parents, it cannot be a perfect
  explanation.</p>

  <p>A third explanation takes that part of the second for granted which assumes that cuckoos select
  nests of the species which served them as foster-parents, and explains the mimicry, when this
  occurs, as due to the results of natural selection.</p>

  <p>Our interest, however, in the domestic economy of the common cuckoo is not to be allowed to
  drop with the incubation of the egg. The perfidy of the parents seems to have cast a sombre shadow
  over the cradle of the offspring, an evil spell destined to bear fruit with terrible suddenness;
  for the young, before it is many hours old, and while yet blind and naked, perpetrates its first
  act of wrong-doing by committing murder! There is no case here of wilful or ignorant
  misrepresentation and slander, such as many of our feathered friends are made to suffer at our
  hands&mdash;no foolish prejudice such as has blasted the reputation of some of our most guiltless
  and useful of bird-citizens. The witnesses of the crime of which we speak are many and
  unimpeachable. The facts are as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The parent cuckoo deposits her egg in the nest of some other bird with those of the owners
  thereof. All are hatched. In a few hours after the arrival of the young cuckoo the foster-brothers
  and -sisters invariably disappear, and are not seldom found in the immediate neighbourhood of the
  nest. That they must have been removed by force is certain; but this force cannot be attributed to
  the natural parents. The evidence of the first witnesses, therefore, was worthy of all
  consideration; and since their accounts have been frequently <span class="pagenum"
  id="page496"><span class="smaller">{496}</span></span>confirmed by most trustworthy observers, we
  must now admit the charge proved. One of the best known of these accounts is that of Mrs. Hugh
  Blackburn. She has given us a vivid picture of this most extraordinary of domestic tragedies. The
  victims in this instance were meadow-pipits. Finding a pipit's nest with a cuckoo's egg therein,
  she kept it carefully under observation. At one visit she found the pipits hatched, but not the
  cuckoo. Forty-eight hours later the cuckoo had not only arrived, but ousted his foster-brothers
  and -sisters, who were found lying outside the nest, but yet alive. They were replaced beside the
  cuckoo, which at once reopened hostilities for the purpose of maintaining its absolute possession
  of the nursery. This it did by burrowing under one of them, which, balanced upon its back, it
  proceeded to eject by climbing up the nest tail-foremost, till, reaching the brim, it could
  relieve itself of its burden by heaving it over the edge and down the bank. Pausing a moment, it
  then felt backwards with its wings to make sure the pipit was really gone, and, having satisfied
  itself on this point, subsided to the bottom of the nest. Next day, when the nest was visited, the
  remaining pipit was found outside the nest cold and dead. "But what struck me most," she writes,
  "was this: the cuckoo was perfectly naked, without a vestige of a feather or even a hint of
  feathers, its eyes were not yet opened, and its neck seemed too weak to support the weight of its
  head. The pipits had well-developed quills on the wings and back, and had bright eyes partially
  opened, yet they seemed quite helpless under the manipulations of the cuckoo, which looked a much
  less developed creature."</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Great Spotted Cuckoo</span> of South Europe and North Africa is a species
  which, though parasitic, does not seem to have sunk to such a depth as the common cuckoo. Its eggs
  very closely resemble those of certain magpies and crows within its breeding-area, and it is in
  the nests of these that they are deposited. We may assume that mimicry has been resorted to, and
  become perfected by the same means as have accomplished this end in the case of the common cuckoo.
  We notice here, however, two points of difference therefrom. In the first place, from two to four
  eggs are left in each nest instead of one; and, secondly, the young cuckoos seem to live in
  perfect amity with their foster-brothers and -sisters&mdash;there is no ejection of the rightful
  heirs.</p>

  <p>Having pledged themselves to a course of deception and treachery, there is no telling the
  lengths to which such conduct may lead. We have already seen that the bird has succeeded in laying
  what we may call forged eggs, but we come now to an instance where the young has also to be
  disguised. This is furnished by a species of cuckoo known as the <span class="sc">Koel</span>,
  inhabiting Palawan, an island in the Philippines. This bird shifts its parental duties upon the
  shoulders of a species of myna inhabiting the same island. Now, the mynas are black, and their
  young, as is often the case where both sexes are coloured <span class="pagenum" id="page497"><span
  class="smaller">{497}</span></span>alike, resemble the parents, and are black likewise. With the
  cuckoo the case is different. The male and female are conspicuously different in coloration, the
  former being black, the latter brown. In such cases it is the rule for the young to wear the
  livery of the female. If this rule were adhered to in the case of the cuckoo, destruction would be
  more than probable, for the mynas would as likely as not destroy so outrageous a departure from
  myna custom as a brown youngster. But the koel has proved equal to the occasion, by the simple
  expedient of attiring the young in the male instead of the female livery. Later on in life the
  rule for the exchange of plumage is reversed, and the young female doffs the temporary black dress
  of the male for the brown one of the adult female, instead of vice vers&acirc;.</p>

  <p>All cuckoos, however, are not parasitic, the species known as <span class="sc">Lark-Heeled
  Cuckoos</span>&mdash;from the presence of a long, spine-like claw on the hind toe&mdash;building a
  nest and hatching their own eggs. They have a wide range, being found in Africa from Egypt to Cape
  Colony, Madagascar, India, China, New Guinea, and Australia.</p>

      <p class="sp0">A young cuckoo remains in the nest till fully fledged.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As a rule, the Cuckoos are not conspicuously coloured, but some species are clad in a livery
  resplendent with metallic colours. These are represented by the Indian and Australian <span
  class="sc">Bronze Cuckoos</span> and the African <span class="sc">Golden Cuckoos</span>. One of
  the most beautiful of all is the African <span class="sc">Emerald Cuckoo</span>, in which the
  upper-parts are of a vivid emerald-green, whilst the under-parts are bright yellow.</p>

  <p>Finally, we must mention the <span class="sc">Ground-Cuckoos</span>, which are comparatively
  long-legged, terrestrial forms, with small wings. One of the best known is an inhabitant of the
  Southern United States, from Texas to New Mexico, Southern Colorado, and California. "It has
  obtained the name of <span class="sc">Road-runner</span>," writes Dr. Sharpe, "from the speed with
  which it flies over the ground, some idea of which may be gained from a statement of Colonel
  Stevenson, that, when in Southern California, he saw, on two occasions, the ranchmen of that part
  of the country chase one of these birds on horseback for a distance of a mile or more at full
  speed, when the cuckoo, though still in advance, would suddenly stop and fly up among the upper
  limbs of some stunted tree or bush near the roadside, and the rider, having kept the bird in view
  all the way, would dismount and easily take the exhausted bird from its perch alive."</p>

  <p>That the African <span class="sc">Plantain-Eaters</span>, or <span class="sc">Touracos</span>,
  are related to the Cuckoos there can be no doubt, although they do not bear any very close
  superficial resemblance to them. Striking in appearance and of beautiful plumage, they owe as much
  of the interest which now centres on them to the chemist as to the ornithologist. Long ago it was
  noticed that the rich crimson colour of the wing-quills disappeared after exposure to a heavy
  rain, having been <span class="pagenum" id="page498"><span
  class="smaller">{498}</span></span>apparently washed out&mdash;a supposition justified by the
  discovery still later that the water in which captive species had been bathing was strongly tinged
  with colour. A little more than thirty years ago these facts came under the notice of Professor
  Church, who, as a result of a thorough examination of the mystery, was enabled to announce the
  discovery of a new animal pigment containing copper, which he called "turacin."</p>

      <p class="sp0">This photograph was taken in August, an unusually late date to find these birds
      in the nest.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There are twenty-five different species of plantain-eaters, which are divided into two
  groups&mdash;those which have red in the quills and those without. All are forest-dwellers,
  feeding upon various wild fruits, building a nest of sticks resembling that of a pigeon, and
  laying therein three white eggs. The majority of the species are crested and brilliantly coloured,
  but a few are quite soberly clad. The largest of the tribe is nearly 3 feet long, and a brief
  description of its coloration will serve to convey a notion of the beauty of the more gorgeously
  clad members. In this species, then, the upper surface of the body is blue, the tail yellow, with
  a blue base and black bar across the tip, the under surface of the body rufous brown, the bill
  yellow, with a scarlet tip, and the eye red.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Though the tops of the highest trees seem to be their favourite resort, these birds
  are found also among the dense tangled masses of creepers near the ground, flitting, when
  disturbed, in graceful curves, and alighting with crest erected and the tail turned sharply
  upwards. The powers of flight appear to vary among the different species, some being described as
  decidedly clumsy on the wing, whilst others, on the contrary, are light and graceful. Shy and very
  restless, they are very difficult to procure, when wounded running with great speed, and taking
  shelter in holes in trees. Their flesh is esteemed a great delicacy by the natives. Save during
  rain or the heat of midday, they appear to be very noisy birds, having a harsh note, varied with
  cat-like mewings.</p>

  <p>Crow-like birds of brilliant coloration, the <span class="sc">Rollers</span> have earned their
  name from the habit of occasionally rolling or turning over in their flight, after the manner of
  tumbler-pigeons. One species at least visits Britain occasionally, only to be shot down at once by
  the insatiable pot-hunter and collector of rare birds. They are birds of wide distribution,
  occurring over the greater part of the Old World, and, as we have already remarked, of brilliant
  coloration, blue and green, varied with reddish, being the predominating colours. As with all
  birds of beautiful plumage, they are subjected to much persecution, thousands upon thousands being
  killed every year in India alone, to supply the demands made by milliners for the decoration of
  ladies' hats.</p>

      <p class="sp3">KINGFISHERS AT HOME.</p>
      <p class="sp0">The plumage of this bird is remarkable for the beauty of its iridescent
      hues.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Rollers frequent forest country, and travel in pairs or in small companies: some species are
  entirely insectivorous; others eat also reptiles, frogs, beetles, worms, and grain. Four or five
  white eggs are laid in a nest made of roots, grass, hair, and feathers, and built in walls, under
  the eaves of buildings, or in holes of trees or banks.</p>

  <p>Equally beautiful as a whole, and far more widely known, are the <span
  class="sc">Kingfishers</span>. But just as the common cuckoo has come to overshadow the rest of
  its tribe, so the <span class="sc">Common Kingfisher</span> eclipses all its congeners. For
  centuries a wealth of fable, held together by a modicum of fact, served to secure for this bird a
  peculiar interest; whilst to-day, though shorn of much of the importance with which these fables
  had invested it, this kingfisher is still esteemed one of the most interesting and beautiful of
  its tribe.</p>

  <p>Green and blue are the predominating colours of its upper- and bright chestnut-red of its
  under-surface; but owing to structural peculiarities of the feathers of the upper-parts, the
  reflection of the green and blue areas changes with the direction of the light from which the bird
  is viewed, in the same way that the peacock's train-feathers change according as the light falls
  upon them.</p>

  <p>As is the rule where both sexes are brilliantly coloured, this bird breeds in a hole, which in
  the present species is generally excavated in the bank of a stream, but sometimes in an old
  gravel-pit or chalk-pit, a mile or even more from the water. Occasionally the crumbling soil under
  the roots of an old tree affords sufficient shelter. No nest is made, although what is equivalent
  to a nest is ultimately formed from the bird's habit of ejecting the indigestible parts of its
  food on to the floor of the space in which the eggs are laid. In course of time this becomes a
  cup-shaped structure; but whether, as Professor Newton remarks, by the pleasure of the bird or the
  moisture of the soil, or both, is unknown. With care the nest may be removed entire, but the
  slightest jar reduces the whole to the collection of fish-bones and crustacean skeletons of which
  it was originally composed. There is a tradition, not yet extinct, to the effect that these
  "nests" are of great pecuniary value, and scarcely a year passes without the authorities at the
  British Museum being offered such a treasure, at prices varying from a few pounds to a hundred.
  The nest-chamber is approached by a tunnel sloping upwards, and varying from 8 inches to 3 feet in
  length, terminating in a chamber some 6 inches in diameter, in which the eggs are laid. These,
  from six to eight in number, have a pure white, shining shell, tinged with a most exquisite pink
  colour, which is lost when the eggs are blown.</p>

  <p>The young seem to be reared under very unsanitary conditions, for the ejected fish-bones and
  other hard parts are not reserved entirely for the nest, but gradually distributed along <span
  class="pagenum" id="page501"><span class="smaller">{501}</span></span>the tunnel approaching it;
  later, fish brought for the young, but dropped on the way, and the fluid excreta of the parents
  are added, forming a dripping, fetid mass swarming with maggots. The young, on leaving the nest,
  are at first tenderly fed and cared for by the parents, but towards the end of the summer seem to
  be driven away to seek new fishing-grounds for themselves.</p>

  <p>Of the many legends that have grown up around this bird, some are well worth repeating.
  Specially interesting is one related by Professor Newton on the authority of the French naturalist
  Rolland. This has it that the kingfisher was originally a plain grey bird, and acquired its
  present bright colours by flying towards the sun on its liberation from Noah's ark, when its
  upper-surface assumed the hue of the sky above it, and its lower plumage was scorched by the heat
  of the setting sun to the tint it now bears. Not a few virtues were also attributed to this bird.
  Its dried body would, it was believed, avert thunder-bolts, or, kept in a wardrobe, preserve from
  moths the woollen stuffs contained therein, whilst, hung by a thread from the ceiling of a room,
  it would serve like the more conventional weather-cock to point the direction of the prevailing
  wind.</p>

  <p>Persecuted though it is, the kingfisher is by no means a rare bird in England, and those who
  will may generally see it by the banks of some slowly flowing stream or lake, or even shallow
  brook, sometimes even by the seashore. It feeds upon small aquatic insects and crustacea and small
  fishes, sometimes even, it is said, upon leeches. Perched on some bough overhanging the water, or
  stump or railing on the bank, it watches patiently, silent and motionless. The moment its prey
  comes within striking distance it plunges down upon it, disappearing for a moment beneath the
  surface, to appear the next with its capture in its beak. If this be a fish, it is held crosswise,
  and borne upwards to the station from which the plunge was made, there to be stunned by a few
  sharp blows, tossed into the air, dexterously caught, and swallowed head-foremost. At times,
  however, perhaps when hunger presses, more activity in the capture of food is displayed, the bird
  hovering suspended over the water, after the custom of the kestrel-hawk.</p>

  <p>Although essentially fish-eating birds, a considerable number live far removed from water,
  obtaining a livelihood by the capture of insects in forest regions, whilst some appear to feed
  mainly on reptiles. These are known as Wood-kingfishers, to distinguish them from the
  Water-kingfishers, the typical member of which group has been just described.</p>

  <p>Of the <span class="sc">Wood-kingfishers</span>, or <span class="sc">Kinghunters</span>, as

  Kingfishers</span>, so called from the fact that the two middle tail-feathers are produced into
  two long rods, terminating in a spoon-shaped enlargement. Although represented by no less than
  twenty distinct species, they have a somewhat limited range, being found only in the Moluccas, New
  Guinea, and Northern Australia. One of the handsomest of all is the one occurring in Amboina, an
  island in the Malay Archipelago, where it was discovered by Mr. A. R. Wallace. The <span
  class="pagenum" id="page502"><span class="smaller">{502}</span></span>bill, he tells us, is
  coral-red, the under-surface pure white, the back and wings deep purple, while the shoulders,
  head, and nape, and some spots on the upper part of the back and wings, are pure azure-blue. The
  tail is white, narrowly edged with blue. These birds live upon insects and small land-mollusca,
  which they dart down upon and pick up from the ground just as the fish-eating species pick up a
  fish.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Of the forest-haunting species, however, the best known is probably the large and, for a
  kingfisher, dull-coloured <span class="sc">Laughing-Jackass</span>, or <span class="sc">Settler's
  Clock</span>, of Australia. Its food is of a very mixed character&mdash;small mammals, reptiles,
  insects, and crabs being devoured with equal relish. Since it is not seldom to be seen bearing off
  a snake in its bill, it may be regarded as a useful bird&mdash;supposing, of course, the snake to
  be of a poisonous variety. A good idea of the bird in its native haunts is given by the late Mr.
  Wheelwright. "About an hour before sunrise," he writes, "the bushman is awakened by the most
  discordant sounds, as if a troop of fiends were shouting, whooping, and laughing around him in one
  wild chorus. This is the morning song of the 'laughing-jackass,' warning his feathered mates that
  daybreak is at hand. At noon the same wild laugh is heard, and as the sun sinks into the west it
  again rings through the forest. I shall never forget the first night I slept in the open bush in
  this country. It was in the Black Forest. I woke about daybreak after a confused sleep, and for
  some minutes I could not remember where I was, such were the extraordinary sounds that greeted my
  ears: the fiendish laugh of the jackass, the clear, flute-like notes of the magpie, the hoarse
  cackle of the wattle-birds ... and the screaming of thousands of parrots as they dashed through
  the forest, all giving chorus, formed one of the most extraordinary concerts I have ever heard,
  and seemed, at the moment, to have been got up for the purpose of welcoming the stranger to this
  land of wonders on that eventful morning. I have heard it hundreds of times since, but never with
  the same feelings that I listened to it then. The laughing-jackass is the bushman's clock, and
  being by no means shy, of a companionable nature, and a constant attendant on the bush-tent and a
  destroyer of snakes, is regarded, like the robin at home, as a sacred bird in the Australian
  forests. It is an uncouth-looking bird ... nearly the size of a crow, of a rich chestnut-brown and
  dirty white colour, the wings slightly chequered with light blue, after the manner of the British
  jay. The tail-feathers are long, rather pointed, and barred with brown.... It is a common bird in
  all the forest throughout the year, breeds in the hole of a tree, and the eggs are white."</p>

  <p>Whilst the Kingfishers are remarkable for the wondrous beauty of their coloration, the <span
  class="sc">Hornbills</span>, their allies, attract our attention rather by the grotesqueness of
  their shape, due to the enormous size of the bill, and the still more remarkable horny
  excrescences which surmount it in not a few species, forming what is known as a "casque." Absent
  in some of the smaller and possibly more primitive forms, its gradual development may be traced,
  beginning <span class="pagenum" id="page503"><span class="smaller">{503}</span></span>with a
  series of corrugations along the ridge of the base of the bill, gradually increasing, to form, in
  the most extreme cases, huge superstructures of quaint shapes, and apparently of great solidity.
  As a matter of fact, however, these casques are practically hollow, save in the case of the <span
  class="sc">Helmet-Hornbill</span> of the Malay countries, in which the horny sheath is backed by
  solid supports of bone, whilst the front of the sheath itself is of great thickness and surprising
  density, and is used by the natives for carving and making brooches and other ornaments. The use
  of this powerful hammer&mdash;for such it may possibly be&mdash;is unknown.</p>

  <p>Hornbills are forest-birds, feeding upon fruit and insects, the latter being captured on the
  wing. With large bill and wings, a long tail, and a relatively small body and short legs, they are
  rather unwieldy birds, and yet, for many reasons, unusually interesting. Their nesting habits are
  unique, and quite worth recounting here at some length. Of the many accounts, one of the most
  interesting, as well as one of the latest, is that of Mr. Charles Hose, of Borneo.</p>

  <p>"The nest," he writes, "is always built in the hollow of a large tree&mdash;the hollow, be it
  noted, being always due to disease of the tree or the ravages of termites, not to the personal
  labours of the birds. The bottom of this cavity is often plugged by a termites' nest and
  accumulation of decayed wood, and on the upper surface of this is made the nest, a very
  rough-and-ready structure, composed simply of the feathers of the female. The hollow of the tree
  communicates with the exterior air by means of a long aperture, which, just before the period of
  incubation, is closed up almost entirely by the male, simply leaving a long slit open, up and down
  which the beak of the enclosed female can move. The substance used in thus closing the aperture
  closely resembles some vegetable resin, and is probably composed of a gastric secretion, combined
  with the woody fragments of fruit. It should be noticed that this slit is always in close
  proximity to the nest, so that the female can easily protrude her beak <span class="pagenum"
  id="page504"><span class="smaller">{504}</span></span>for food without moving from her sitting
  position. During incubation the male bird supplies the female with food in the form of pellets of
  fruit, seeds, insects, portions of reptiles, etc., the pellets being enclosed each in a skin of
  rubber-like consistency. While feeding the female, the male clings to the bark of the tree, or
  sits on a branch if conveniently near, and jerks these pellets into the gaping beak of the hen,
  two to four pellets forming a meal. During mastication (for it is a mistake to suppose that the
  hornbills always bolt their food entire) some fragments of the pellets fall to the ground, and
  seeds which these fragments may contain take root, germinate, and sprout, and the natives can
  judge approximately of the date of incubation by the age of the seedlings. When these are
  four-leaved, the eggs have been hatched out for two or three weeks. At this stage, though not
  always so early, the mother bird leaves the nest, breaking down the gluey substance with her beak
  to effect an exit; having left the nest, the aperture through which she left is carefully closed
  up again, leaving the slit as before, and now both male and female devote their energies to
  feeding the young birds, which in course of time follow the example of their mother and leave
  their place of imprisonment. It is more than probable that this gluing up first of the mother bird
  and her eggs and afterwards of the nestlings alone is solely a means of protection against
  predacious carnivora....</p>

      <p class="sp0">The Hornbills derive their name from the great size of the bill.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"The nesting-season is during May and June, and it is noteworthy that the birds, if
  undisturbed, return to the same nesting-place every year. The saplings at the foot of the tree,
  sprung from seeds dropped in the first year of paring, afford signs to the natives of the number
  of years during which the tree has been occupied. If during paring or incubation the female or
  female and young are destroyed, the male takes to himself another mate, and repairs to the same
  nesting-place; if, however, the male and female are destroyed, the nest is never reoccupied by
  other pairs. An interesting incident was observed while on Mount Dulit. Espying on a tree the
  external signs of a hornbill's nest, and a male rhinoceros perched close by, I shot the male, and
  while waiting for my Dyak collectors to make a ladder up the tree to secure the female, I observed
  several young male birds fly to the nest and assiduously ply the bereaved widow with food, a fact
  which seems to indicate a competition in the matrimonial market of the bird-world as severe as
  that among human beings. It is no easy matter to procure embryos or nestlings of hornbills, for
  the natives are inordinately fond of both as articles of diet, and, further, are always anxious to
  secure the tail-feathers of the adults to adorn their war-coats and hats.</p>

  <p>"The native method of catching the female during incubation is ingenious, though <span
  class="pagenum" id="page505"><span class="smaller">{505}</span></span>decidedly brutal. The tree
  is scaled, the resin-like substance is broken away, and the frightened bird flies from her nest up
  the hollow trunk of the tree, but is ignominiously brought down by means of a thorny stick (the
  thorns point downward), which is thrust after and twisted about until a firm grip in her plumage
  is obtained. The Dyaks, never very faithful observers of nature, believe that the female is shut
  up by the male, so that after hatching her eggs she may die, the maggots in her putrefying body
  affording food for the young. One very curious habit of the rhinoceros-hornbill which I have not
  hitherto seen noted is the rapid jumping up and down on a branch with both feet together. This
  jumping motion is imitated by the Kyans and Dyaks in their dances, the figure being known to the
  Kyans as 'wan blingong.'"</p>

  <p>That the <span class="sc">Hoopoes</span>, unlike as they may be in general appearance, are
  nevertheless intimately related to the Hornbills there can be no doubt. Graceful in contour and
  pleasing in coloration, it is a pity that the species which so frequently visits Britain, and has
  on more than one occasion nested there, should be so ruthlessly shot down immediately its presence
  is discovered. Save the wings and tail, the body is of a light cinnamon colour, whilst the head is
  surmounted by a magnificent crest of black-and-white-tipped feathers, which can be raised or
  depressed at the pleasure of the bird: the excepted portions of the plumage&mdash;the wings and
  tail&mdash;are buff, varied with bands of black and white. Thus it may be truthfully said to be a
  conspicuously coloured bird; yet this same livery seems also to come under the head of protective
  coloration, for we are assured that, when danger threatens, the bird throws itself flat upon the
  ground, spreads out its wings, and at once becomes transformed into what rather resembles a heap
  of rags than a bird. Escape by flight, however, instead of subterfuge, seems also at times to be
  resorted to, since, when pursued by a falcon, it will mount rapidly to a great height, and not
  seldom effect its escape.</p>

  <p>The domestic habits of the hoopoe are, however, by no means so charming as one would expect to
  find in so beautiful a bird. "All observers agree," writes Professor Newton, "in stating that it
  delights to find its food among filth of the most abominable description, and this especially in
  its winter quarters. But where it breeds, its nest&mdash;usually in the hole of a tree or of a
  wall&mdash;is not only partly composed of the foulest materials, but its condition becomes worse
  as incubation proceeds, for the hen scarcely ever leaves her eggs, being assiduously fed by the
  cock as she sits <span class="pagenum" id="page506"><span class="smaller">{506}</span></span>(a
  feature strongly recalling the custom of the hornbills), and when the young are hatched their
  f&aelig;ces are not removed by their parents, as is the case with most birds, but are discharged in the
  immediate neighbourhood of the nest, the unsanitary condition of which can readily be imagined.

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>BEE-EATERS, MOTMOTS, TODIES, COLIES, AND
  TROGONS.</i></p>

  <p>In the present chapter we deal with a number of birds of singular beauty and gracefulness. In
  their coloration green predominates, thus recalling the Rollers, Parrots, Plantain-eaters, and
  Kingfishers, all of which groups, as we have seen, contain a large proportion of green
  species.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Bee-eaters</span>, like the Kingfishers, Hornbills, and Hoopoes, have a
  foot of quite peculiar structure, the middle and outer toes being joined together throughout the
  greater part of their length. They are an Old World group, ranging from the British Islands to
  Australia, in the American Continent their place being taken by the Motmots and Jacamars, of which
  we shall speak presently. They are especially plentiful in the African region, somewhat less so in
  the Indian, the temperate regions of the Old World possessing but few species.</p>

  <p>On rare occasions one species visits the British Islands. This is, furthermore, one of the most
  beautiful of the group. It has the head, neck, upper back, and a broad wing-bar of a ruddy-brown
  colour; the lower back buff colour; green wings and tail, with black tips to the middle
  tail-feathers, which are longer than the rest. The forehead is pale green and white; the
  ear-coverts are black; and the throat bright yellow, divided from the greenish-blue under-parts by
  a black band. "The name Bee-eater," writes Mr. Evans, "is well deserved, for in Spain [it] is a
  perfect pest to the bee-keeper, catching the workers as they enter and leave the hives." Like the
  Kingfishers, the indigestible parts of the food are cast up and deposited around the eggs, though
  bee-eaters do not appear to form a nest of them, as with the Kingfishers.</p>

  <p>From four to six eggs of a beautiful glossy white colour are deposited in holes in banks,
  or&mdash;and this is worthy of special notice&mdash;in tunnels bored vertically downwards in level
  ground for a distance of from 3 to 10 feet. How this is done is a mystery, for the bird's beak and
  feet look by no means equal to such a task. No nest appears to be made, the eggs being deposited
  at the extremity of the burrow without further preparation. Two species of the group, however, are
  said to form an exception, constructing a nest of straw and feathers. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page507"><span class="smaller">{507}</span></span>These two, as well as the members of the
  genus to which the British bird belongs, apparently breed in colonies.</p>

      <p class="sp0">A native of the Malay countries. The long feathers on the throat are bright
      scarlet.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Unfortunately for the bee-eater, its flesh is palatable, whilst its plumage is in great demand
  for millinery purposes. Its persecution is of long standing, since more than 300 years ago Belon
  witnessed a particularly cruel experiment practised by the boys in Crete. Transfixing a beetle
  with a bent pin, to the head of which a thread was tied, and then holding its other end with their
  hand, they would let the insect fly. The bee-eater, which catches most of its prey on the wing,
  would dart upon it, and, swallowing the bait, be caught by the hook.</p>

  <p>Not unlike the Bee-eaters in general appearance and coloration, the <span
  class="sc">Motmots</span> are birds of peculiar interest, and this on account of a remarkable
  habit of one of their tribe&mdash;a habit which is perfectly unique, and to which we shall return
  presently. Belonging, as we have already remarked, to the New World, they range from Southern
  Mexico to Paraguay, inhabiting dense forests, and being but rarely seen. The plumage is somewhat
  loose in character&mdash;green, blue, cinnamon, and black in colour. The beak has the margins
  serrated, or saw-like; whilst the feet resemble those of the Kingfishers and Bee-eaters. As with
  the Bee-eaters, no nest is made. The eggs, three or four in number and creamy white in colour, are
  deposited in a hole bored by the birds themselves in a tree or bank, both sexes sharing in the
  work of incubation. Their food consists of insects caught in the air, small reptiles, and
  fruit.</p>

  <p>The remarkable habit to which we have referred is displayed by the species known as the <span
  class="sc">Racket-Tailed Motmot</span>, from the fact that the two middle tail-feathers project
  beyond the others, and have the greater part of the shaft bare, but terminating in a spoon-shaped
  expansion. In this there is nothing unusual, for such racket-feathers are common amongst birds. In
  this particular case, however, the feathers were originally entire, and acquired their
  characteristic shape artificially, the bird nibbling away the vane on either side of the shaft
  with its bill until the required shape is obtained. Such an act of conscious decoration on the
  part of a bird is elsewhere unknown throughout the whole class.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Todies</span> are diminutive allies of the Motmots, frequenting hilly
  districts and woods. They sit with the beak pointed upwards, the head drawn in close to the body,
  and the plumage puffed out, apparently oblivious of all around them&mdash;at least it would seem
  so, since at such times they may be caught with a butterfly-net. Like their larger allies, they
  are green in coloration, but have a light red throat, and yellowish-white or pinkish under-parts,
  with green or pink flank-feathers. They vary in length from 3 to 4&frac12; inches.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page508"><span class="smaller">{508}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Colies</span>, or <span class="sc">Mouse-birds</span>, of South Africa are
  small, crested, long-tailed, loose-plumaged birds whose exact relationships are somewhat puzzling.
  The name Mouse-bird is given on account of the habit of creeping along the boughs of trees with
  the whole foot applied to the branch. The toes are peculiar in that all turn forwards, and are
  commonly so retained. About ten species are known, ranging from Abyssinia southwards.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Resplendent without doubt are the majority of the forms which we have been lately considering,
  but probably the palm for gorgeous coloration should be given to the <span
  class="sc">Trogons</span>&mdash;at least they must be allowed to share the honours with the
  Humming-birds.</p>

  <p>The most splendid of all is the <span class="sc">Quezal</span>, the male of which has a train
  of great length, resembling at first sight a tail. But, as in the peacock, this is formed by
  enormously elongated tail-coverts, concealing the true tail. These tail-coverts differ, however,
  markedly from those in the peacock in that they are not erectile, but pendent. The head is
  ornamented with a large, rounded crest; the ground-colour of the upper parts of the plumage is of
  brilliant metallic green; the under parts from the chest downwards are of a deep blood-red.
  Certain of the covert-feathers of the wing form elegant drooping plumes, hanging down on either
  side and giving a wonderfully beautiful effect.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The late Mr. Salvin's account of this bird in its wild state is well worth quoting.
  Hunting with a native for this bird in the forest, where alone it is to be met with, he writes: "A
  distant clattering note indicates that the bird is on the wing. He settles&mdash;a splendid
  male&mdash;on a bough of a tree, not seventy yards from where we are hidden. Cipriano wants to
  creep up to within shot, but I keep him back, wishing to risk the chance of losing a specimen
  rather than miss such an opportunity of seeing the bird in its living state, and of watching its
  movements. It sits almost motionless on its perch, the body remaining in the same position, the
  head only moving from side to side. The tail is occasionally jerked open and closed again, and now
  and then slightly raised, causing the long tail-coverts to vibrate gracefully. I have not seen
  all. A ripe fruit catches the quezal's eye, and he darts from his perch, hovers for a moment,
  picks the berry, and returns to his former position. This is done with a degree of elegance that
  defies description."</p>

  <p>Gaudy in plumage, and somewhat ungainly in appearance, it must nevertheless be admitted that
  the <span class="sc">Toucans</span> form an exceedingly interesting group of birds. On account of
  their huge and gaily coloured beaks, they have been imagined to be related to the Hornbills; but
  even judging by this character, the two groups may be readily distinguished; for whereas the
  typical beak of the hornbill is surmounted by a large casque, the beak of the toucan is <span
  class="pagenum" id="page509"><span class="smaller">{509}</span></span>never so ornamented. The
  solid appearance of the beak in the toucan, by the way, is as much a fiction as with the hornbill,
  since the horny sheath is supported, not on a core of solid bone, but on a frame of delicate bony
  filigree-work, the spaces being filled by air. The coloration of the plumage (which is somewhat
  loose in character), as well as of the bare skin round the eye and the beak-sheath, is most
  brilliant, and displays immense variation amongst the different species.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Shy and restless in their habits, toucans travel generally in small flocks amongst the
  forest-trees and mangrove-swamps in search of food, which consists mainly of fruits and seeds,
  varying this diet occasionally with ants and caterpillars. It is to this diet of fruit that the
  great size of the bill and its peculiar saw-like edges are to be traced&mdash;at least this is the
  opinion of the great traveller-naturalist Bates, who had so many opportunities of watching these
  birds. "Flowers and fruit," he writes, "on the crowns of the large trees of South American forests
  grow principally towards the end of slender twigs, which will not bear any considerable weight.
  All animals, therefore, which feed principally upon fruit, or on insects contained in flowers,
  must, of course, have some means of reaching the ends of the stalks from a distance. Monkeys
  obtain their food by stretching forth their long arms, and in some instances their tails, to bring
  the fruit near to their mouths; humming-birds are endowed with highly perfected organs of flight,
  with corresponding muscular development, by which they are enabled to sustain themselves on the
  wing before blossoms whilst rifling them of their contents; [and the long bill of the toucan
  enables it] to reach and devour fruit whilst remaining seated, and thus to counterbalance the
  disadvantage which its heavy body and gluttonous appetite would otherwise give it in the
  competition with allied groups of birds."</p>

  <p>Toucans appear to be much esteemed as articles of food&mdash;at least during the months of June
  and July, when these birds get very fat, the flesh being exceedingly sweet and tender. They nest
  in holes of trees at a great height from the ground, and lay white eggs.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable of the group is the <span class="sc">Curl-crested Toucan</span>,
  from the fact that the feathers on the crown of the head are peculiarly modified to form
  scroll-like, glossy curls, which have been compared to shavings of steel or ebony. Mr. Bates
  writes: "I had an amusing adventure one day with one of these birds. I had shot one from a rather
  high tree in a dark glen in the forest, and entered the thicket where the bird had fallen to
  secure my booty. It was only wounded, and on my attempting to seize it set up a loud scream. In an
  instant, as if by magic, the shady nook seemed alive with these birds, although there was
  certainly none visible when I entered the jungle. They descended towards me, hopping from bough to
  bough, some of them swinging on the loops and cables of woody lianas, and all croaking and
  fluttering their wings like so many furies. If I had had a long stick in my hand, I could have
  knocked several of them over. After killing the wounded one, I began to prepare for obtaining more
  specimens and punishing the viragos for their boldness. But the screaming of their companion
  having ceased, they remounted the trees, and before I could reload every one of them had
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>With neither charm of colour nor peculiar shape, the small African birds known as <span
  class="sc">Honey-guides</span> are some of the most remarkable of birds, and this on account of a
  quite <span class="pagenum" id="page510"><span class="smaller">{510}</span></span>unique habit of
  inducing other animals, not even excepting man, to hunt for them. Sir John Kirk, writing of its
  habits in the Zambesi district, says: "The honey-guide is found in forests and often far from
  water, even during the dry season. On observing a man, it comes fluttering from branch to branch
  in the neighbouring trees, calling attention. If this be responded to&mdash;as the natives do by
  whistling and starting to their feet&mdash;the bird will go in a certain direction, and remain at
  a little distance, hopping from one tree to another. On being followed, it goes further; and so it
  will guide the way to a nest of bees. When this is reached, it flies about, but no longer guides;
  and then some knowledge is required to discover the nest, even when pointed out to within a few
  trees. I have known this bird, if the man, after taking up the direction for a little, then turns
  away, come back and offer to point out another nest in a different part. But if it does not know
  of two nests, it will remain behind. The difficulty is that the bird will point to tame bees in a
  bark hive as readily as to those in the forest. This is natural, as the bee is the same, the bark
  hive ... being simply fastened up in a tree, and left for the bees to come to.... The object the
  bird has in view is clearly the young bees. It will guide to nests having no honey, and seems
  equally delighted if the comb containing the grubs is torn out, when it is seen pecking at
  it."</p>

      <p class="sp0">So called from the curiously curled feathers on the head, resembling black and
      glistening shavings.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>An old rumour had it that honey-guides occasionally lured men on to spots where lions or other
  large and dangerous beasts lay hid. No credence whatever is now given to such tales, it being
  readily understood that the bird's course may by accident pass directly above perils of this kind,
  without the slightest cognisance of this on the part of the bird.</p>

  <p>The honey-guide, however, presses into its service one of the lower mammals&mdash;the ratel.
  The fondness of this animal for bees is well known, and by none better than this little bird,
  which, by pointing out nests to its more powerful companion, earns as a reward the broken bits
  which remain after the feast.</p>

  <p>Allies of the sombre-coloured Honey-guides are the <span class="sc">Jacamars</span> and <span
  class="sc">Puff-birds</span>. The former are rather handsome birds, though small, having the
  upper-parts of a metallic coppery golden green, and more or less rufous below. Ranging from Mexico
  to South Brazil, they may usually be found on the outskirts of forests, near water, sitting
  perched on the bare boughs of lofty trees for hours at a time. They feed on moths and other
  insects, caught on the wing, and brought back and crushed against the bough before swallowing.
  They lay white eggs in the holes of trees.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Puff-birds</span>, though closely allied to the foregoing, are more
  soberly clad. Black, brown, and rufous in hue, they lack the resplendent metallic markings of the
  Jacamars. Their geographical range extends from Guatemala and Honduras to Argentina. Though
  numerous species and genera are known, the nest and eggs appear to have been discovered in the
  case of one species only: these were found in a hole in a bank, and contained two shining white
  eggs.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Barbets</span> are possibly more closely related to the Honey-guides than
  the Jacamars and Puff-birds. Brilliantly coloured, and having a plumage exhibiting violent
  contrasts of red, blue, purple, and yellow, on a green ground, sometimes with crests, bare skin
  round the eye, and brightly coloured bills, the barbets are, in spite of a somewhat hairy
  appearance, exceedingly attractive birds.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page511"><span class="smaller">{511}</span></span></div>

  <p>Forest-dwellers, like their allies, they feed upon fruit, seeds, insects, bark, and buds; but
  so noiseless are they said to be when feeding that their presence is betrayed only by the falling
  of berries they have accidentally released.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that the geographical range of the barbet is much wider than that of
  its immediate allies, extending through tropical Asia, Africa, and America.</p>

  <p>The Woodpecker Tribe constitutes a large group, generally divided into two sections&mdash;the
  <span class="sc">Woodpeckers</span> and the <span class="sc">Wrynecks</span>.</p>

  <p>The former are characterised by their large heads and very powerful bills and long and
  exceedingly stiff tails. The feet are also peculiar, two toes pointing directly forwards and two
  backwards. Beak, feet, and tail are all specially adapted to the peculiar habits of these birds,
  which pass their lives upon trees, climbing the trunks, and searching the interstices of the bark
  for ants, or drilling holes into the unsound portions of the trunk itself for the purpose of
  extracting the grubs which feed upon decaying wood.</p>

      <p class="sp0">This woodpecker is a British species.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That ants and other small insects form the staple diet of the woodpecker is evident from the
  extraordinary length of the tongue. This is a long, worm-like structure, capable of being
  protruded many inches from the beak, and covered with a sticky secretion, so that, thrust into
  colonies of ants, it quickly becomes covered with them, to be withdrawn immediately into the mouth
  and cleared again for further action.</p>

  <p>Woodpeckers are all birds of bright plumage, some particularly so, and have a wide geographical
  distribution, inhabiting all parts of the world save Madagascar, the Australasian region, and
  Egypt.</p>

  <p>Three species occur in the British Islands, though they are exceedingly rare in Scotland and
  Ireland. The <span class="sc">Green Woodpecker</span> is a particularly handsome bird. Grass-green
  is the predominating colour of its livery, relieved by a light scarlet cap, a golden patch over
  the lower part of the back, and chequered bars on the wings and quills.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page512"><span class="smaller">{512}</span></span></div>

  <p>Scarcely less beautiful, in their way, are the <span class="sc">Greater</span> and <span

      support.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Spotted</span> and <span class="sc">Black Woodpeckers</span> are
  remarkable for a curious drumming sound, so powerful as to be distinctly audible even a mile off.
  It appears to be caused by hammering vigorously on the bark of some rotten branch, the bird's head
  moving with amazing rapidity as it beats out this curious tattoo.</p>

  <p>Three North American species, known as <span class="sc">Sap-suckers</span>, have the curious
  habit of piercing the boles of trees for the purpose of procuring the sap which flows copiously
  when the tree is so "tapped." Another species of the same region seems to be possessed of a
  persistent dread of famine, storing up immense quantities of nuts, which it appears never
  afterwards to use. These nuts are tightly fixed into holes in the bark of trees, and in such
  numbers that "a large pine 40 or 50 feet high will present the appearance of being closely studded
  with brass nails, the heads only being visible."</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Wrynecks</span> differ from the Woodpeckers mainly in that the
  tail-feathers are soft instead of spiny. Although sombre, the plumage is yet very beautiful,
  having a velvety appearance, variegated with pearl-grey, powdered or dusted over a general
  groundwork of nut-brown, buff, and grey. Bars and fine lines add still more to the general effect,
  and render description still more difficult. One species is common in England. It is known also as
  the <span class="sc">Cuckoo's Mate</span> and the <span class="sc">Snake-bird</span>. The former
  name is given in allusion to the fact that it arrives with the cuckoo, the latter from its strange
  habit of writhing its head and neck, and also on account of its curious hissing note, made when
  disturbed on its nest. It has the long, worm-like tongue of the woodpecker, but without a barbed
  tip.</p>

  <p>The habit of writhing the head and neck often serves the wryneck in good stead. Nesting in a
  hole in a tree, escape is difficult so soon as the discoverer has come to close quarters. The
  untried egg-collector, for instance, peering down into the nest, and seeing nothing distinctly,
  but only a moving head, and hearing a hissing sound, imagines the hole to be tenanted by a snake,
  and beats a hasty retreat, only to catch a glimpse, a moment later, of the bird hurrying out of
  its perilous hiding-place. Should he, however, discovering the true state of affairs, put down his
  hand and seize the bird, it will adopt yet other resources. Clinging tightly to its captor's
  finger, it will ruffle up its feathers, stretch out its neck, and at the same time move it jerkily
  and stiffly about, and finally, closing its eyes, hang downwards, as if dead. Then, before the

  <p class="sp3">The extensive group of Perching-birds is defined mainly from the characters
  afforded by the structure of the voice-organ, and these are of much too technical a nature to be
  discussed here. Suffice it to say that, on account of these characters, the group is further
  divided into two sections, and each section again divided into two.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Crows, Orioles, Finches, and Their Allies.</span></p>

  <p>At the head of the tribe stands, by general though by no means universal consent, the Crow
  Family, of which the recognised chief is the <span class="sc">Raven</span>, a bird which has for
  thousands of years commanded a more than passing interest amongst mankind. Renowned as the truant
  from the Ark, or as the wonderful minister of the prophet Elijah, there are few even of the
  youngest amongst us who do not know of its striking personality. The poet and the dramatist have
  both made use of the raven, and it would seem that it has even found a place in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page515"><span class="smaller">{515}</span></span>mythology of the Red Indian.
  The smaller relatives of this celebrated bird, the <span class="sc">Rook</span>, the <span
  class="sc">Carrion-crow</span>, and the <span class="sc">Jackdaw</span>, and more distantly the
  <span class="sc">Jay</span> and the <span class="sc">Magpie</span>, are doubtless as familiar to
  our readers as the raven.</p>

  <p>Although probably unknown to many, the <span class="sc">Chough</span>, with its glossy black
  plumage and brilliant red bill and feet, is a British bird, and lives still in certain parts of
  England, though fast verging on extinction.</p>

  <p>Another very remarkable member of the family is the <span class="sc">Huia</span>, and this on
  account of the fact that the male and female differ markedly in respect of the shape of the bill,
  this being in the female long and sickle-shaped, and in the male short and cone-shaped. This bird
  frequents the wooded regions of North Island, New Zealand, living upon grubs found in decaying
  wood, and on berries. The female procures the grubs by probing the holes which they have made in
  the sounder wood, the male by breaking away the decayed portions of the tree; but occasionally it
  happens that, having cleared away as much of the decayed material as possible, the latter is
  unable to reach his prey, in which case he calls up the female, and yields his find to her, to
  extricate with her longer bill. So great a difference in the form of the bill in the sexes of the
  same species is elsewhere unknown among birds.</p>

  <p>The Crows hold the important position of head of the Class birds, yet they are far outshone in
  splendour by many of the groups already examined, though, with the exception perhaps of the
  Humming-birds, these all pale before the <span class="sc">Birds of Paradise</span>.</p>

  <p>Varying in size from a crow to a thrush, the best known of the latter is the <span
  class="sc">Great Bird of Paradise</span>, which was discovered towards the end of the sixteenth
  century, if not earlier. On their first discovery it was popularly supposed that these birds lived
  in the air, turning always to the sun, and never alighting on the earth till they died, for they
  had neither feet nor wings. Hence the Malay traders called them "God's Birds," the Portuguese
  "Birds of the Sun," and the Dutch "Paradise-birds." Seventeen or eighteen inches long, these birds
  have the body, wings, and tail of a rich coffee-brown, which deepens on the breast to a blackish
  violet or purple-brown. The top of the head and neck are of a delicate straw-yellow, the feathers
  being short and close-set, <span class="pagenum" id="page516"><span
  class="smaller">{516}</span></span>resembling velvet. The throat-feathers have a scaly appearance,
  and are emerald-green in colour. The flank-feathers on either side of the body form a dense mass
  of long, delicate, waving plumes, sometimes 2 feet in length, of an intense orange colour, and
  shining with a wonderful gloss. These feathers can be raised and spread out at pleasure, so as to
  almost conceal the wearer in a fountain-like rain of feathers. This wonderful plumage is worn by
  the male only, the female being quite plainly dressed. In May, when they are in full dress, the
  males assemble early in the morning to exhibit themselves, forming what are known as
  "dancing-parties," which take place on the topmost boughs of some giant tree. "From a dozen to
  twenty birds assemble together," writes Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace, "raise up their wings, stretch
  out their necks, and elevate their exquisite plumes, keeping them in continual vibration.
  Between-whiles they fly across from branch to branch in great excitement, so that the whole tree
  is filled with waxing plumes in every variety of attitude and motion." The native hunter marks
  these playing-places, builds a shelter of palm-leaves in a convenient situation among the
  branches, and ensconces himself under it before daylight, armed with a bow and a number of arrows
  terminating in a round knob. When the dance is in full swing, he shoots through the roof of his
  shelter with the blunt arrows, stunning every bird he strikes, which, falling down at once, are
  immediately picked up by a boy in waiting below. Often a considerable number will be thus secured
  before the alarm is taken.</p>

  <p>Without coloured figures, or very numerous photographs from living birds, which we can hardly
  hope to get, it would be impossible, except at the risk of being wearisome, to describe all the
  wonderful combinations of form and colour which the feathers of the birds of paradise display.
  Breast-shields of metallic sheen, fans and crests in wonderful variety, feathers of a texture like
  velvet, or gorgeous colours, confuse one in their variety and combination. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page517"><span class="smaller">{517}</span></span>Let it suffice to mention only the last
  discovered species&mdash;the <span class="sc">King of Saxony's Bird of Paradise</span>. "Velvety
  black above," writes Dr. Sharpe, "and yellowish below, there is nothing very striking in the
  aspect of the bird itself, which is smaller than our song-thrush. But the 'streamers' which it
  carries! Poised ... on either side of the head is a long, shaft-like plume, from which depends, on
  the lower side only, a series of little flags of blue enamel, each quite separate from the one
  which precedes it, and not of a feathery structure in the least."</p>

  <p>Close allies of the Birds of Paradise are the remarkable <span class="sc">Bower-birds</span> of
  Australia. Conspicuously beautiful in coloration as are some members of this tribe, they are
  celebrated not so much on this account as for an extraordinary habit of constructing "bowers" or
  "playing-grounds"&mdash;a trait which appears absolutely unique among birds. "These
  constructions," observes Mr. Gould, "consist in a collection of pieces of stick or grass, formed
  into a bower; or one of them (that of the <span class="sc">Spotted Bower-bird</span>) might be
  called an avenue, being about 3 feet in length, and 7 or 8 inches broad inside; a transverse
  section giving the figure of a horse-shoe, the round part downwards. They are used by the birds as
  a playing-house, or 'run,' as it is termed, and are used by the males to attract the females. The
  'run' of the <span class="sc">Satin-bird</span> is much smaller, being less than 1 foot in length,
  and, moreover, differs from that just described in being decorated with the highly coloured
  feathers of the Parrot Tribe. The <span class="sc">Spotted Bower-bird</span>, on the other hand,
  collects around its 'run' a quantity of stones, shells, bleached bones, etc.; they are also
  strewed down the centre within."</p>

      <p class="sp0">A native of New Guinea; remarkable for the curled tail-feathers.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>More wonderful still are the structures reared by the <span class="sc">Gardener-bird</span> of
  New Guinea, presenting, as Professor Newton remarks, "not only a modification of bower-building,
  but an appreciation of beauty perhaps unparalleled in the animal world.... This species ... builds
  at the foot of a small tree a kind of hut or cabin ... some 2 feet in height, roofed with
  orchid-stems that slope to the ground, regularly radiating from the central support, which is
  covered with a conical mass of moss, and sheltering a gallery around it. One side of this hut is
  left open, and in front of it is arranged a bed of verdant moss, bedecked with blossoms and
  berries of the brightest colours. As these ornaments wither they are removed to a heap behind the
  hut, and replaced by others that are <span class="pagenum" id="page518"><span
  class="smaller">{518}</span></span>fresh. The hut is circular and some 3 feet in diameter, and the
  mossy lawn in front of it nearly twice that expanse. Each hut and garden are, it is believed,
  though not known, the work of a single pair of birds, or perhaps of the male only; and it may be
  observed that this species, as its trivial name implies, is wholly inornate in plumage. Not less
  remarkable is the more recently described 'bower' of the <span class="sc">Golden
  Bower-bird</span>.... This structure is said ... to be piled up almost horizontally around the
  base of a tree to the height of from 4 to 6 feet, and around it are a number of hut-like fabrics,
  having the look of a dwarfed native camp." Allied species, though building no bowers, yet clear a
  space of ground some 8 or 9 feet in diameter, on which to display themselves, and ornament this
  with little heaps of gaily tinted leaves, replacing them as they fade with fresh specimens.</p>

  <p>We pass next to the birds of the Starling Family, of which the <span class="sc">British
  Starling</span> is the type. A bird so familiar needs no description here; but we may draw
  attention to the many interesting phases of plumage this species undergoes.</p>

  <p>The first plumage is a uniform greyish brown. Later black feathers, with large white spots at
  the tips, make their appearance among the brown. These spotted feathers eventually replace the
  brown, and the bird enters upon a second quite distinct phase&mdash;a black, spotted with white.
  Gradually this gives place to a plumage entirely unspotted, the feathers on the breast being
  spear-shaped. In the adult dress a wondrous variety of metallic reflections is
  acquired&mdash;green, purple, and violet.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Associating in the autumn and winter in large flocks, starlings move from place to place in
  search of food. Sometimes the number of birds in these combined flocks rises to an enormous
  figure. One of the largest of these gatherings recorded in England existed on the property of the
  late Mr. Miles near Bristol. "This locality is an evergreen plantation ... covering some acres, to
  which these birds repair <span class="pagenum" id="page519"><span
  class="smaller">{519}</span></span>of an evening ... by millions, from the low grounds about the
  Severn, where their noise and stench are something altogether unusual. By packing in such myriads
  upon evergreens, they have stripped them of their leaves, except just at the tops, and have driven
  the pheasants, for whom the plantation was intended, quite away from the ground. In the daytime,
  when the birds are not there, the stench is still excessive. Mr. Miles was about to cut the whole
  plantation down, to get rid of them, two years ago, but I begged him not to do so, on account of
  the curiosity of the scene, and he has since been well pleased that he abstained."</p>

  <p>A similar but still larger congregation has been described; in this, about the year 1845, from
  150,000 to 200,000 starlings were computed to rest every night, between the end of October and the
  end of March, in certain trees in the gardens of the Zoological Society in Dublin. The roof of St.
  Patrick's Cathedral, in the heart of Dublin, has from time to time been resorted to, as many as
  2,000  seeking shelter there. "Possessing very considerable powers of wing," observes Yarrell,
  "these are turned to account in an extraordinary manner by the birds composing the flock. They
  wheel, close, open out, rise and descend, as if each were obeying a commander, and all this is
  done with the utmost marvellous precision while the flock is proceeding at a rapid pace through
  the air. At times it may extend in a long and nearly straight thread; suddenly an undulation is
  visible along the line, and in a moment it takes the form of a thin and smoke-like cloud; another
  moment, and it is a dense and almost perfect globe; then possibly, having preserved this
  appearance for a perceptibly longer time, it becomes pear-shaped, and in another instant has
  assumed a spiral figure; an instant after it has spread out like a sheet, and its members are
  streaming softly along the ground, perhaps to alight, or perhaps once more to mount aloft and
  circle as before." There are few more magnificent sights in the world than a flock of starlings
  when performing evolutions of this kind.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Differing much, not only in general appearance, but also in coloration, from the common
  starling is the <span class="sc">Rose-coloured Starling</span>, so called from the beautiful
  rose-pink colour of the back and breast, set off by the rest of the plumage, which is black,
  glossed with violet, blue, and green reflections. This handsome bird occasionally visits Britain.
  Feeding largely upon locusts, these birds are much affected in their movements by the
  peregrinations of these pests; and this accounts for the sporadic appearance of the rose-coloured
  starling in huge flocks in places where it is generally seldom seen.</p>

  <p>Dull in appearance, ungraceful in flight, and with a harsh, unmusical note, the starling <span
  class="pagenum" id="page520"><span class="smaller">{520}</span></span>known as the <span
  class="sc">Ox-pecker</span> would seem at first sight to have little to recommend it; yet it is
  one of the benefactors of the larger African mammals, clearing them of flies and other
  insect-pests. Buffaloes, rhinoceroses, elephants, are alike grateful for its services, as it
  climbs about their huge bodies, picking off the liliputian enemies by which they are beset. But
  little appears to be known of the breeding-habits of these birds.</p>

  <p>In strong contrast to the dull-looking Ox-birds are the beautiful <span class="sc">Glossy
  Starlings</span> and <span class="sc">Grackles</span>. The <span class="sc">African Glossy
  Starlings</span>, indeed, represent the most beautiful of all the members of the Starling Tribe.
  In one of the handsomest and best-known species&mdash;the <span class="sc">Long-tailed Glossy
  Starling</span>&mdash;metallic green and purple-violet are the predominating tones in the plumage,
  glossed with copper reflections, and relieved by black or darker bars of green and purple. In
  another species&mdash;the <span class="sc">Green Glossy Starling</span> of Eastern
  Africa&mdash;the shimmer of the plumage is so wonderful that the exact shades of colour are
  difficult to describe, in that they change completely, according to the light in which the bird is
  held.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Grackles</span>, or <span class="sc">Hill-mynas</span>, are Indian birds,
  with glossy black plumage, relieved by bare flaps of yellow skin projecting backwards from the
  head immediately behind the eye. These birds make excellent pets, learning both to whistle and
  talk.</p>

  <p>We come now to the beautiful <span class="sc">Orioles</span>&mdash;birds belonging to the
  temperate and tropical parts of the Old World. The males, as a rule, are clad in a vestment of
  brilliant yellow and black, but in some species the under-parts are relieved by rich crimson. One
  species&mdash;the <span class="sc">Golden Oriole</span>&mdash;has on several occasions visited the
  British Islands, and even in one or two instances has nested there. But, as with all brightly
  plumaged birds in England, no sooner is their presence discovered than they are doomed to fall to
  the gun of some local collector.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Hang-nests</span>, <span class="sc">Cow-birds</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Rice-birds</span> are American birds, bearing in many respects a resemblance to the
  Starlings, chiefly, perhaps, in the form of the beak. Generally black in plumage, in many bright
  colour is conspicuous.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Hang-nests</span> range from North and Central America to Southern Brazil. As
  a rule they are brilliantly coloured, the livery being bright orange and yellow, set off by black
  and white. The majority of the numerous species build remarkable nests, looking like long
  stockings, which they hang from the under side of the bough of a tree; they are composed of coarse
  grass deftly woven together.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Cow-birds</span> are mostly South American, though the United States
  possess two or three species. Some, like the Cuckoos, are parasitic, dropping their eggs into the
  nests of other birds, to be hatched by the owners: the young cow-bird, however, dwells in harmony
  with his foster-brothers and -sisters, instead of ejecting them from the nest, like the young
  cuckoo. The name Cow-bird is bestowed upon these birds on account of the persistent way in which
  they haunt herds of cattle for the sake of the flies which congregate about those animals.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Rice-birds</span> are represented by some rather showy forms, and others
  of wonderful powers of song. The typical <span class="sc">Rice-bird</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Bob-o-link</span>, is an especial favourite as a songster. Thoreau writes of this song:
  "It is as if he [the bird] touched his harp with a wave of liquid melody, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page521"><span class="smaller">{521}</span></span>and when he lifted it out the notes fell
  like bubbles from the strings.... Away he launched, and the meadow is all bespattered with
  melody." Where rice is extensively cultivated, however, this bird is by no means so
  enthusiastically welcomed, causing immense destruction to the standing crops&mdash;flocks
  numbering, it has been said, some millions alighting in the fields and leaving too little grain to
  be worth the trouble of gathering.</p>

  <p>We pass now to a group of exceedingly interesting birds, some of which are remarkable on
  account of the beauty of their plumage, others from their wonderful nesting-habits. The group
  includes many familiar as cage-birds, such as the <span class="sc">Long-tailed Widow-birds</span>,
  the <span class="sc">Red-beaked Waxbills</span>, <span class="sc">Amadavats</span>, <span
  class="sc">Java Sparrow</span>, <span class="sc">Grass-finches</span>, <span
  class="sc">Munias</span>, and so on, all of which are embraced under the general title of <span
  class="sc">Weaver-birds</span>, a name bestowed on account of their peculiar nests.</p>

      <p class="sp3">MEADOW-LARK (NATURAL SIZE).</p>
      <p class="sp0">Known also as the Meadow-starling. This bird, a native of the Eastern United
      States, has occurred three times in the British Islands, but it is doubtful whether these
      specimens were wild.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Abundant in Africa, and well represented in South-eastern Asia and Australia, these birds bear
  a strong family resemblance to the Finches, from which they differ in having ten primary quills in
  the wings.</p>

  <p>One of the most peculiar is the South African <span class="sc">Long-tailed Whydah-</span> or
  <span class="sc">Widow-bird</span>. Strikingly coloured, this bird is rendered still more
  attractive by the extremely elongated tail-feathers, which are many times longer than the body, so
  long, indeed, as to impede its flight, which is so laboured that children commonly amuse
  themselves by running the bird down. Kaffir children stretch lines coated with bird-lime near the
  ground across fields of millet and Kaffir corn, and thereby capture many whose tails have become
  entangled among the threads.</p>

  <p>In brilliancy of coloration the Whydah-birds&mdash;for there are several species&mdash;are
  pressed hard <span class="pagenum" id="page522"><span class="smaller">{522}</span></span>by the
  <span class="sc">Bishop-birds</span>, the handsomest of which is the red species. Sociable in
  habits, this bird throughout the year consorts in immense flocks, which in the summer consist
  chiefly of males.</p>

  <p>Of the more remarkable nest-builders, the most conspicuous are the <span class="sc">Baya
  Sparrows</span>, or <span class="sc">Toddy-birds</span>, of India and Ceylon, and the <span
  class="sc">Sociable Weavers</span>. The former suspend their nests by a solidly wrought rope of
  fibre from the under side of a branch, the rope expanding into a globular chamber, and then again
  contracting into a long, narrow, vertical tube, through which the birds make their exit and
  entrance. The latter&mdash;the <span class="sc">Sociable Weaver-bird</span> of Africa&mdash;builds
  a still more wonderful structure. As a thing apart it has no existence, a number of birds, varying
  from 100 to 300, joining their nests together, so as to form a closely interwoven structure,
  resembling, when finished, a gigantic mushroom. The structure is built among the branches of large
  trees, so that the tree looks as though it had grown up through a native hut, carrying the roof
  with it. Cartloads of grass are required to rear this structure, which is nearly solid. Seen from
  below, it presents a flat surface riddled with holes; these are the entrances to the nests.</p>

  <p>Closely resembling the typical Finches in general appearance, and often gorgeous in coloration,
  is the group known as the <span class="sc">Tanagers</span>, of which more than 400 distinct
  species are known to science. Exclusively American, the majority of the species are found in
  Central and South America, though a few move northwards into the United States in summer. The most
  beautiful are the <span class="sc">Scarlet</span>, <span class="sc">Crimson-headed</span>, and
  <span class="sc">White-capped Tanagers</span>. The last-named is generally allowed to be the
  loveliest of the group. The entire plumage of both sexes is a beautiful cornflower-blue,
  surmounted by a cap of silvery-white feathers, a crimson spot on the forehead looking like a drop
  of blood. The identical coloration of the sexes is worth noting, as among the tanagers generally
  the female is dull-coloured.</p>

  <p>Among the Finches there is a considerable variety of coloration, though but little in bodily
  form; they are all attractive birds, and have the additional advantage that many are British.
  Distributed over both the northern and temperate regions of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres,
  they are unknown in Australia. The group, which comprises a very large number of species, may be
  divided into three sections&mdash;<span class="sc">Grosbeaks</span>, <span class="sc">True
  Finches</span>, and <span class="sc">Buntings</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Grosbeaks</span>, as their name implies, are characterised by the great
  stoutness of the beak, and some, as the <span class="sc">Evening-grosbeaks</span> of America, are
  remarkable for their beauty.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Well-known British members of this section are the <span class="sc">Hawfinches</span> and <span
  class="sc">Greenfinches</span>. Common in many parts of England, though rare in Scotland and
  Ireland, the <span class="sc">Hawfinch</span> contrives to make itself much disliked by the
  gardener, owing to its fondness for peas, though it fully compensates for the damage done in this
  direction by the numbers of noxious insects it destroys. The nest is a very beautiful structure;
  outside it is composed of twigs intermixed with lichens, inside of dry grasses lined with fine
  roots and hair. The site chosen varies, a favourite place being an old apple- or pear-tree in an
  orchard; but the woods and fir plantations are not seldom resorted to. The <span
  class="sc">Greenfinch</span> is an equally common British bird. Of a more confiding disposition
  than the hawfinch, it makes an excellent cage-bird, becoming with judicious treatment exceedingly
  tame. It is a useful bird, travelling during the autumn and winter in large flocks, and feeding on
  the seeds of wild mustard and other weeds. Its nest differs conspicuously from that of the
  hawfinch, being a somewhat untidy structure, composed of fibrous roots, moss, and wool, lined with
  finer roots, horsehair, and feathers.</p>

  <p>Among the <span class="sc">True Finches</span>, distinguished from the Grosbeaks by their less
  powerful bills, are several other well-known British birds. Of these, none are better known than
  the <span class="sc">Chaffinch</span>. Gay in appearance and sprightly in habit, this is a general
  favourite everywhere, and much in demand as a cage-bird. His short though delightful song
  possesses a peculiar charm, coming as it does with the earliest signs of returning spring. The
  fascination of this song has never been better expressed than in Browning's lines<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="poem poemc22">
    <p>O to be in England</p>
    <p>Now that April's there;</p>

  </div>

  <p>The nest, which is an exceptionally beautiful structure, takes about a fortnight to build.
  Closely woven, it appears to consist mainly of wool, into which moss and lichens of various
  colours are deftly woven. The outside is cunningly decorated with bits of lichen and the inner
  bark of trees, such as the birch, the whole being secured by a thin veil of spiders' webs. The
  lichen and bark serve to render the nest inconspicuous by blending it with the general appearance
  of the bush or small tree in a forked bough of which it is placed. Inside the wool is more closely
  felted even than on the outside, and this is covered with fine hairs, amongst which a few feathers
  are intermixed. The work of building seems to be done by the female only, though the male helps by
  bringing the materials.</p>

      <p class="sp3">BULLFINCH.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Black varieties are occasionally taken in a wild state. Caged specimens fed on
      hemp-seed frequently turn black.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of the <span class="sc">Goldfinch</span>, <span class="sc">Linnets</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Bullfinch</span>, by far the most popular and beautiful is the <span
  class="sc">Goldfinch</span>, which is, and probably will long remain, one of the most prized of
  cage-birds. Gifted "with the fatal gift of beauty," this bird is much persecuted by bird-catchers;
  and indeed, partly owing to the depredations of these men, and partly to improved methods of
  agriculture, which have diminished its feeding-area, this handsome bird is growing more and more
  rare every year.</p>

  <p>Next to the goldfinch perhaps the <span class="sc">Linnet</span> is most sought after as a
  cage-bird. Large numbers are taken during the autumn, when the birds congregate in large flocks
  before departure on migration. Those captured in the spring are said to be very impatient of
  confinement, and only a small percentage seem to survive.</p>

  <p>The linnet is one of the most variable of birds in the matter of plumage, and for a long while
  the opinion was generally held, especially by bird-catchers, that several distinct <span
  class="pagenum" id="page525"><span class="smaller">{525}</span></span>species&mdash;the <span
  class="sc">Red</span>, <span class="sc">Brown</span>, and <span class="sc">Grey
  Linnets</span>&mdash;existed. It is now known that these are all phases of plumage common to one
  species. In the male in full summer dress the forehead and centre of the crown are blood-red,
  whilst the breast is of a glossy rose-red; but these bright colours do not seem to be acquired so
  universally as is the case with other birds which don a special breeding-dress, nor are they ever
  developed in captivity. Occasionally what are called <span class="sc">Lemon-breasted</span>
  varieties of the linnet occur in which the rose-colour of the breast is replaced by yellow.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Bullfinch</span>, though one of the common British birds, is by no means
  so abundant as the two foregoing species; for whilst the other two travel in small flocks, the
  bullfinch is a solitary bird. Few birds perhaps have earned a more evil name than the bullfinch,
  which is accused by the gardener of inflicting enormous damage on the flower-buds of fruit-trees
  in winter and spring. "On the other hand," writes Mr. Hudson, "he is greatly esteemed as a
  cage-bird, and the bird-catchers are ever on the watch for it. But the effect in both cases is
  pretty much the same, since the hatred that slays and the love that makes captive are equally
  disastrous to the species." That it is diminishing in many districts there can be no doubt, and
  perhaps its final extermination is only a matter of time. Though by no means a remarkable songster
  in a wild state, in captivity it is capable of learning to whistle strains and airs of human
  composition with some skill, good performers fetching high prices.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sparrow</span> and the wild <span class="sc">Canary</span> of
  Madeira&mdash;from the latter of which our cage-pets have been derived&mdash;are also members of
  the Finch Tribe, but are too well known to need fuller mention.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Closely allied to the Finches are the <span class="sc">Buntings</span>, which are really only
  slightly modified finches. Several species are British birds, one of the commonest being the <span
  class="sc">Corn-bunting</span>, a bird which bears a wonderful resemblance to a skylark, from
  which, however, it may be distinguished by its large beak and small claw on the hind toe.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Yellowammer</span>, or <span class="sc">Yellowhammer</span>, is another
  familiar roadside form in England, which scarcely needs description.</p>

  <p>The most celebrated of all the buntings is the <span class="sc">Ortolan</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Green-headed Bunting</span>, a bird resembling its congener the yellowhammer, but
  lacking its bright coloration. It has acquired fame from the delicate flavour of its flesh, and to
  supply the demand for this delicacy immense numbers are netted annually by the bird-catchers of
  the Continent. Wintering in North Africa, these birds leave Europe in September in large flocks,
  and it is during this migration and the return journey in the spring that their ranks are so
  mercilessly thinned. Common over the greater part of Europe, it is somewhat surprising that the
  ortolan does not occur more frequently in the British Islands, where it is only an occasional
  spring and autumn visitor.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Snow-bunting</span>, or <span class="sc">Snowflake</span>, is a regular
  winter visitant to the British Islands, some pairs indeed remaining to breed in the Highlands of
  Scotland every year, whilst its presence serves to enliven some of the dreariest spots of high
  northern latitudes. The male in breeding-dress is a handsome bird, having the upper-parts black
  and the under white; its mate is somewhat duller, the black parts being obscured by greyish white,
  fulvous, and blackish <span class="pagenum" id="page526"><span
  class="smaller">{526}</span></span>brown, whilst the white parts are less pure in tone. The full
  dress of the male is rarely seen in the British Islands, save in specimens procured from Scotland;
  for in winter, when the snow-bunting is chiefly captured, the plumage is altogether more
  rufous.</p>

      greenfinch.</p>

  <p>Unlike the buntings so far described, the <span class="sc">Reed-bunting</span> is to be found
  only in marshy places, but in suitable localities it may be found in the British Islands all the
  year round, being as common a species as the corn-bunting, and therefore not calling for special
  description here.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The eggs of the buntings are remarkable for the curious scribble-like markings

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>LARKS, TITMICE, HONEY-EATERS, AND THEIR
  KINDRED.</i></p>

  <p>Confined almost entirely to the Old World, where they are represented by more than one hundred
  species, many of which have undergone considerable specialisation in the matter of plumage, so as
  to enable them to live in desert regions, the <span class="sc">Larks</span> constitute a
  well-marked group, into the characters of which we need not enter here.</p>

  <p>The best-known member of the group is the <span class="sc">Skylark</span>. Common throughout
  the British Islands, and of sober coloration, no bird is more universally beloved, and this
  largely on account of the sweetness of its song, which is second only to that of the nightingale.
  Poets and prose-writers alike have sounded its praises, many in passages that will be remembered
  as long as our language lasts. The skylark is one of the few birds which sing while on the wing;
  the peculiar nature of the flight at this time all must have watched, entranced the while by the
  beauty of the song.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page527"><span class="smaller">{527}</span></span></div>

  <p>Grahame, in his "Birds of Scotland," happily describes the nest as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="poem poemc22">
    <p>The daisied lea he loves, where tufts of grass</p>
    <p>Luxuriant crown the ridge; there, with his mate,</p>
    <p>He founds their lowly house, of withered bents,</p>
    <p>And coarsest speargrass; next, the inner work</p>
    <p>With finer and still finer fibres lays,</p>
    <p>Rounding it curious with its speckled breast.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This bird displays great affection for its young, removing them under the fear of impending
  danger, or if the nest is meddled with. Occasionally, however, the bird sits close, instead of
  seeking safety by flight.</p>

  <p>Brighton enjoys the credit of consuming more larks than any other place in England, except
  London. It has been estimated that the number of larks annually entering the metropolitan markets
  alone reaches a total of 400,000&mdash;20,000 or 30,000 being often sent together; and the numbers
  eaten elsewhere in the country must be enormous, quite as large, indeed, as abroad. Most are
  captured from the hosts which arrive on the east coast of Scotland and England from the Continent
  on approach of severe weather, the birds making their appearance in thousands, forming a constant
  and unbroken stream for two or three days in succession.</p>

  <p>Close allies of the Larks, the <span class="sc">Wagtails</span> and <span
  class="sc">Pipits</span> come next under consideration. The former range over the Old World, but
  are unknown in Australia and Polynesia. The pipits have a similar range, but one species is found
  in, and is peculiar to, Australia. Like wagtails, pipits are unknown in Polynesia; only two
  species occur in America.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Wagtails</span> are generally black and white, grey and white, grey with
  yellow breasts, or yellowish green with yellow breasts. In the last-mentioned case, as in some
  specimens of the <span class="sc">Yellow Wagtail</span>, the yellow predominates. These birds
  frequent streams and stagnant waters, like the <span class="sc">Red</span> and <span
  class="sc">Grey Wagtails</span>; or corn-fields and meadows, as in the case of the <span
  class="sc">Yellow Wagtail</span>. All these are commonly met with in the British Islands.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Pipits</span> are duller-coloured than the Wagtails, have shorter tails,
  and evince less fondness for the water. The <span class="sc">Meadow-</span>, <span
  class="sc">Rock-</span>, and <span class="sc">Tree-pipits</span> are the commonest British
  species.</p>

  <p>Neither Wagtails nor Pipits are much given to perching, but the <span
  class="sc">Tree-creepers</span> spend their lives upon trees, some being specially modified for
  this mode of life, their tail-feathers being stiff and terminating in sharp points. By pressing
  its tail closely against the tree-trunk up which it is climbing, the bird obtains a wonderfully
  reliable support. Beginning at the bottom of a trunk, creepers quickly work their way up in a
  spiral direction, or sometimes in jerky zigzags, searching every crevice for tiny insects, their
  eggs and larv&aelig;, and flitting from the higher branches, when these are reached, to the base of
  another tree.</p>

  <p>Creepers are mostly dull-coloured, but the <span class="sc">Wall-creeper</span> has crimson
  patches on the wings. This bird, which has occurred in Britain, haunts mountain-cliffs. The <span
  class="sc">Tree-creeper</span>, a resident in Britain, builds its nest behind pieces of loose
  bark, or under tiles, or in crevices of trees, walls, or hollow branches. In this nest are laid
  from six to nine eggs, pure white, spotted with red, or with a creamy ground-colour, with the
  spots thicker round the large end.</p>

  <p>Intermediate in position between the Creepers and the Titmice are the <span
  class="sc">Nuthatches</span>. Chiefly inhabitants of the northern parts of both hemispheres, they
  extend as far south as Mexico, whilst in the Old World they occur plentifully in the Himalaya. The
  largest species is found in the mountains of Burma. One species is frequently met with in England,
  and occasionally in Scotland, but is unknown in Ireland.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">English Nuthatch</span> may serve us as a type of the group. "Its habits,"
  writes Dr. Sharpe, "are a combination of those of the tit and woodpecker. Like the former bird,
  the nuthatch seeks diligently for its insect-food on the trunks and branches of trees, over which
  it runs like a woodpecker, with this difference, that its tail is not pressed into the service of
  climbing a tree, nor does it generally ascend from the bottom to the top, as a woodpecker so often
  does. On the contrary, a nuthatch will generally be found in the higher branches, and will work
  its way down from one of the branches towards the trunk, and is just as much at home on the under
  side of a limb as the upper. Its movements are like those of a mouse rather than of a bird, and it
  often runs head-downward, or hangs on the under side of a branch and hammers away at the bark with
  its powerful little bill. The noise produced by one of these birds, when tapping at a tree, is
  really astonishing for a bird of its size, and, if undisturbed, it can be approached pretty
  closely. Its general food consists of insects, and in the winter the nuthatches join the wandering
  parties of tits and creepers which traverse the woods in search of food.... In the autumn it feeds
  on hazel-nuts and beech-mast, breaking them open by constant hammering; and, like the tits, the
  nuthatches can be tempted to the vicinity of houses in winter, and become quite interesting by
  their tameness."</p>

  <p>The nuthatch nests in hollow trees, plastering up the entrance with mud, and leaving an
  aperture only just sufficient to enable it to wriggle in and out. A remarkable nest may be seen at
  the British Natural History Museum. It was built in the side of a haystack, to which the
  industrious birds had carried as much as 11 lbs. of clay, and had thus made for themselves a solid
  nest in an apparently unfavourable position.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Titmice</span> occur in one form or another all over Europe, Asia, and
  Africa, and in the New World as far south as Southern Mexico. The family may be divided into <span
  class="sc">True</span>, <span class="sc">Crested</span>, <span class="sc">Long-tailed</span>, and
  <span class="sc">Penduline Tits</span> and <span class="sc">Reedlings</span>, all but the
  penduline tits being represented in England.</p>

  <p>Of the true tits, the best known is the <span class="sc">Blue Tit</span>, which is no stranger
  even in London parks. Travelling in small bands throughout the autumn and winter, they may
  frequently be met with during a country walk, their presence being made known by a pretty tinkling
  little note. This method of travelling is obviously advantageous, for the discovery of food at
  this time is an arduous task, and, if undertaken individually, many would surely starve, as
  Professor Newton points out: "A single titmouse searching alone might hunt for a whole day without
  meeting with a sufficiency, whilst, if a dozen are united by the same motive, it is hardly
  possible for the place in which the food is lodged to escape their detection, and, when
  discovered, a few call-notes from the lucky finder are enough to assemble the whole company to
  share the feast.... One tree after another is visited by the active little rovers, and its
  branches examined: if nothing be forthcoming, away goes the explorer to the next that presents
  itself, merely giving utterance to the usual twitter that serves to keep the whole body together.
  But if the object of search be found, another chirp is emitted, and the next moment several
  members of the band are flitting in succession to the tree, and eagerly engaged with the
  spoil."</p>

  <p>These little birds display great affection for their old nesting-places. An instance is on
  record where, so far back as 1785, a pair built their nest in a large earthenware bottle placed in
  the branches of a tree in a garden at Oxbridge, near Stockton-on-Tees. With two exceptions only,
  this bottle was tenanted by a pair of these birds every year till 1873. In 1892 Professor Newton,
  who had this account from Canon Tristram, was informed that the occupancy had ceased for four
  years.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Long-tailed</span> or <span class="sc">Bottle-tit</span> is a British
  species, deriving its name from the long tail. It is a pretty little bird, black and rose-colour
  above, with a rose-coloured abdomen, and the head, throat, and breast white. It enjoys the
  distinction of being one of the smallest British birds, and is found in woods and plantations all
  over England, though less common in Scotland. These tits have a curious habit of roosting during
  the winter, six or seven huddling together in a row, with three or four others perched on their
  backs, and two or three on the top.</p>

  <p>The nest, which is placed in a tree or bush, is a model of industry. Oval in shape, and roofed,
  with a small aperture near the top, it is composed of moss, lichen, and hair, closely felted and
  lined with an enormous collection of feathers, Macgillivray having counted 2,779 in a single
  nest.</p>

  <p>Other species of titmice occurring in Britain are the <span class="sc">Great</span>, <span
  class="sc">Marsh-</span>, <span class="sc">Coal-</span>, and <span class="sc">Crested
  Tits</span>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page530"><span class="smaller">{530}</span></span></div>

  <p>Whether the <span class="sc">Reedlings</span>, or <span class="sc">Bearded Tits</span>, as they
  are generally called, are really true titmice or peculiarly modified buntings is a moot-point.
  There is but one species, which is British, though found also on the Continent; but it is
  unfortunately becoming more and more rare every year. The general colour of the upper-parts is
  cinnamon-rufous, except the head, which is pearly grey: between the bill and the eyes hangs a tuft
  of long black feathers; hence the name Bearded Tit. The under-parts are white, tinged with yellow
  and pink, whilst the wings are variegated with white, black, and red. This tit lives in beds of
  reeds fringing the "broads" of the eastern counties of England, though even there it is now
  exceedingly rare.</p>

  <p>The same uncertainty that obtains with regard to the position of the Reedlings confronts the
  ornithologist with regard to the affinities of the liliputian <span class="sc">Gold-crests</span>.
  About six species are known, from the northern and temperate parts of the Old and New Worlds,
  extending as far south in the latter as Mexico. Two occur in Britain: one, known simply as the
  <span class="sc">Gold-crest</span>, or <span class="sc">Golden-crested Wren</span>, is fairly
  common; the other, the <span class="sc">Fire-crest</span>, or <span class="sc">Fire-crested
  Wren</span>, is much rarer, but differs very little from its relative in general appearance.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Gold-crest</span> is olive-green above, yellowish grey below, with a
  conspicuous crest of bright yellow and orange, banded on each side by two black lines. It has the
  distinction of being the smallest British bird; and it is partly on account of its smallness, and
  partly owing to its shy, retiring habits, seeking concealment among the foliage, that it is so
  seldom seen, save by those who know where to look for it; and these may find it all the year round
  in suitable places.</p>

  <p>In the spring this bird may be observed suspended in the air for a considerable time over a
  bush or flower, singing very melodiously, though few naturalists have ever witnessed this display.
  Mr. W. H. Hudson, one of these few, writes: "I have observed the male, in the love-season,
  hovering just above the bush, in the topmost foliage of which its mate was perched and partly
  hidden from view. It is when engaged in this pretty aerial performance, or love-dance, that the
  golden-crested wren is seen at his best. The restless, minute, sober-coloured creature, so
  difficult to see properly at other times, then becomes a conspicuous and exceedingly beautiful
  object; it hovers on rapidly vibrating wings, the body in an almost vertical position, but the
  head bent sharply down, the eyes being fixed on the bird beneath, while the wide-open crest shines
  in the sun like a crown or shield of fiery yellow. When thus hovering, it does not sing, but emits
  a series of sharp, excited chirping sounds."</p>

  <p>The nest is a singularly beautiful structure, made of fine, dry grass, leaves, moss, and
  spiders' webs, woven closely together, lined with feathers, and suspended like a hammock beneath a
  branch of yew or fir. In this are laid from six to ten eggs of a pale yellowish white, spotted and
  blotched with reddish brown.</p>

  <p>The numbers of British gold-crests are vastly increased by the arrival on the eastern coast of
  gold-crests from the Continent. "In autumn," writes Mr. Howard Saunders, "immense flocks sometimes
  arrive on our east coast, extending quite across England and the Irish Channel, and into Ireland.
  In 1882 the migration wave of this description, commencing on August 6 and lasting for ninety-two
  days, reached from the Channel to the F&aelig;roes; in 1883 the migration lasted eighty-two days; and
  again in 1884 for a period of eighty-seven days.... On such occasions bushes in gardens on the
  coast are covered with birds as with a swarm of bees; crowds flutter round the lanterns of
  lighthouses, and the rigging of fishing-smacks in the North Sea is thronged with weary travellers.
  In April a return migration occurs."</p>

  <p>We pass now to the consideration of a few families of birds unknown in Britain, but interesting
  on account of the fact that they afford us another set of instances of adaptation to attain
  particular ends, so frequently to be met with in Nature. All the birds in question, though
  probably not related, have peculiarly modified tongues, apparently specially designed to aid in
  sucking up honey from flowers.</p>

  <p>The first group for consideration are the <span class="sc">Honey-eaters</span> of New Zealand
  and Australia. So great is the transformation which the tongue in these birds has undergone, that
  it forms one of the most elaborate organs of its kind, surpassing even that of the Humming-birds.
  A description of this organ without the aid of anatomical terms and diagrams would be useless.
  Suffice it to say it is long, capable of being thrust out of the mouth, and brush-like. It is used
  to thrust up the tubes of honey-bearing flowers, as well for the sake of the juice as for the
  insects gathered in such situations to feed on it.</p>

      British bird, staying with us the whole year round.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The best known of the Honey-eaters is the <span class="sc">Poe</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Parsonbird</span>, of New Zealand. Glossy black in colour, with vivid green and blue
  reflections, it is rendered still more attractive by a pair of white tufts of feathers hanging
  from the front upper part of the neck, whilst on the back of the neck in the same region the
  feathers are of a loose structure, long, and curled forwards. Other honey-eaters are the <span
  class="sc">White-eyes</span>, <span class="sc">Sun-birds</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Flower-peckers</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">White-eyes</span>, so called from a ring of white feathers around the eye,
  have a wide distribution, being found in Australia, India, Africa, Madagascar, and Japan. Besides
  honey they are very partial to fruit, particularly figs and grapes, and also capture insects on
  the wing, after the fashion of fly-catchers.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sun-birds</span> correspond in the Old World to the Humming-birds in the
  New, having, like the latter, a metallic plumage, varied in its hues and wondrous in its beauty;
  but they are not entirely dependent upon this lustre for their charm, for much of their splendour
  is gained from the non-metallic portion of the plumage, which is often vividly <span
  class="pagenum" id="page533"><span class="smaller">{533}</span></span>coloured. The females are
  dull-coloured, whilst the males lose their beauty in the winter season. These birds are
  inhabitants of the tropical regions of Africa, India, and Australia, and seem to revel in the
  burning rays of the noonday sun.</p>

  <p>Nearly allied to the Sun-birds are the <span class="sc">Flower-peckers</span> of the Indian and
  Australian regions. These are all small birds, remarkable as much for the beauty of their nests as
  for the splendour of their plumage. The nests are purse-like structures, made of white cotton-like
  material, and suspended from a branch instead of, as usual, resting on it. One of the most
  beautiful birds of the whole group, which includes numerous species, is the Australian <span
  class="sc">Diamond-bird</span>. Of a general ashy-grey colour, this species is splashed all over
  with spots of red, yellow, orange, and black, whilst the tail-coverts are rich dark red.</p>

  <p>The Shrike Family are an exceedingly interesting group of birds, of world-wide distribution and
  of great diversity of appearance, varying in size from a bird as small as a titmouse to one as
  large as a thrush, and presenting a considerable range of coloration, some being very brightly,
  others dull coloured. From the hooked beak, and the presence of a notch in the tip of the upper
  jaw, they were considered by the older naturalists to be allies of the Birds of Prey, a decision
  still further supported by their hawk-like habit of capturing living prey in the shape of small
  birds and mice; whilst the remarkable custom of impaling their victims, still living, on thorns
  has earned for them the popular name of <span class="sc">Butcher-birds</span>. The limits of the
  family, owing to the diversity of the forms involved, have not as yet been finally determined by
  naturalists, some having included species which others hold have no place there.</p>

  <p>Five species are commonly included in the list of British birds, although only two occur with
  any frequency: of these, the <span class="sc">Great Grey Shrike</span> visits Great Britain every
  winter; whilst the smaller <span class="sc">Red-backed Shrike</span> is an annual summer visitor
  to those islands, breeding, however, only in England, occurring but occasionally in Scotland, and
  being almost unknown in Ireland, where only one specimen has ever been recorded.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Red-backed Shrike</span>, writes Dr. Sharpe, "reminds us of a fly-catcher
  in the way in which [it] captures its food, for it has undoubtedly favourite perches, on which it
  sits, and to which it returns after the capture of an insect. It is frequently to be seen on
  telegraph-wires, where it keeps a sharp look-out in every direction, and a favourite resort is a
  field of freshly cut grass. It also captures a good many mice and small birds, not pursuing them
  in the open like birds of prey, but dropping down on them suddenly. In the British Museum is a
  very good specimen of the larder of a red-backed shrike, taken with the nest of the bird by Lord
  Walsingham in Norfolk, and showing the way in which the shrike spits insects and birds on thorns;
  and the species has been known ... to hang up birds even bigger than itself, such as blackbirds
  and thrushes, as well as tits of several kinds, robins, and hedge-sparrows, while it will also
  occasionally seize young partridges and pheasants."</p>

  </div>

  <p>Though undeniably unmusical, the red-backed shrike is nevertheless able to imitate with
  considerable success the notes of other small birds, decoying them by this means within striking
  distance&mdash;an accomplishment shared also by other members of the Shrike Family. The present
  species is attractively clothed in a plumage varied with black, grey, rufous, and chestnut-brown,
  the last being the predominating hue of the upper-parts; hence the name Red-backed Shrike.</p>

  <p>The habits of its congener, the <span class="sc">Great Grey Shrike</span>, are precisely
  similar. A caged specimen which had become very tame would take food from its captor's hands. When
  a bird was given it, the skull was invariably broken at once, after which, holding the body in its
  claws, the shrike would proceed to tear it in pieces after the fashion of a hawk. Sometimes,
  instead, the carcase would be forced through the bars of the cage&mdash;in lieu of
  thorns&mdash;and then pulled in pieces.</p>

  <p>Very different in appearance from the members of the Shrike Family are a group of possibly
  allied forms known as <span class="sc">Wax-wings</span>. Of pleasing but sober coloration, they
  are remarkable for certain curious appendages to the inner quill-feathers, of a bright sealing-wax
  red colour, from which they derive their name: similar wax-like appendages occur also, sometimes,
  on the tail-feathers.</p>

  <p>Breeding in the Arctic Circle, wax-wings occur in both the Old and New Worlds, though some
  species peculiar to the latter region lack the wax-like appendages characteristic of the majority
  of the species. These birds are erratic in their movements, and large bands occasionally visit the
  British Islands during the autumn and winter, the eastern counties being usually the most favoured
  spots; but on the occasion of one of these immigrations, in the winter of 1872, many were seen in
  the neighbourhood of the North of London. During the summer they feed on insects, but in autumn
  and winter on berries and fruit. At this time they become very fat and are then captured and sold
  in large numbers for food in the Russian markets, and occasionally are sent over to London.</p>

  <p>Passing over a small group of comparatively uninteresting American birds known as "Greenlets,"
  we come to the <span class="sc">Warblers</span>, a group which constitutes one of the largest
  families of birds of the Old World. The species included in this family vary greatly in their
  characters, so that it is by no means easy to give diagnostic characters, whereby they may be
  readily distinguished from the Fly-catchers on the one hand or the Thrushes on the other. The
  Thrushes, however, as a group, may be distinguished from the Warblers by the circumstance that in
  the former the young have a distinctive spotted plumage, differing from that of the adults, while
  the young of the Warblers are not so marked, their plumage differing but little from that of their
  parents.</p>

  <p>More than twenty species of warblers are included amongst British birds. Although some of them
  are but rare and accidental visitors to Britain, others are amongst the commonest of the spring
  migrants, remaining to nest, and leaving again in the autumn. Some, as the <span
  class="sc">Black-cap</span>, <span class="sc">White-throat</span>, <span
  class="sc">Chiff-chaff</span>, <span class="sc">Garden-</span>, <span class="sc">Willow-</span>,

  <p>The <span class="sc">Black-cap</span> and <span class="sc">Garden-warbler</span> rank as

  the two former never clash, so that where black-caps are common there are few garden-warblers, and
  <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

  <p>Most of these birds build a typical cup-shaped nest of dried grasses, lined with finer
  materials, and placed near the ground; but that of the <span class="sc">Reed-warbler</span> is a
  most beautiful structure, the dried grass of which it is made being woven around some three or
  four reed-stems, making it seem as if the latter had, in growing up, pierced the sides of the nest
  <span class="pagenum" id="page537"><span class="smaller">{537}</span></span>in their course. The
  cup-shaped hollow is very deep, so that when the supporting reeds are bowed low in the breeze the
  eggs rest perfectly safe.</p>

  <p>We must pass now to a consideration of the Thrush Tribe, which, as we have already hinted, are
  very closely allied to the Warblers.</p>

  <p>Birds like the <span class="sc">Common Thrush</span> and the <span class="sc">Blackbird</span>
  are so common and so well known that they scarcely need comment here. The same perhaps is true of
  many other members of this group not popularly associated with the Thrush Tribe; such are the
  <span class="sc">Red-breast</span>, or <span class="sc">Robin Red-breast</span>, as it is more
  generally called, and the <span class="sc">Nightingale</span>. Few birds have inspired so many
  writers as the nightingale; it even holds a place in classical mythology. Professor Newton gives
  us one variant of a very common but pretty story: "Procne and Philomela were the daughters of
  Pandion, King of Attica, who in return for warlike aid rendered him by Tereus, King of Daulis in
  Thrace, gave him the first-named in marriage. Tereus, however, being enamoured of her sister,
  feigned that his wife was dead, and induced Philomela to take her place. On her discovering the
  truth, he cut out her tongue to hinder her from revealing his deceit; but she depicted her sad
  story on a robe which she sent to Procne, and the two sisters then contrived a horrible revenge
  for the infidelity of Tereus by killing and serving to him at table his son Itys. Thereupon the
  gods interposed, changing Tereus into a hoopoe, Procne into a swallow, and Philomela into a
  nightingale, while Itys was restored to life as a pheasant, and Pandion (who had died of grief at
  his daughters' dishonour) as a bird of prey [the osprey]."</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A not infrequent error with regard to the red-breast may be pointed out here. Many people seem
  to suppose that the female is less brilliantly coloured than her mate. As a matter of fact this is
  not so; what are generally regarded as females of this species are the dull, spotted young, which,
  as we have already pointed out, assume this peculiar livery throughout the tribe.</p>

  <p>No less common in Britain, during the summer months at least, are the <span
  class="sc">Wheat-ears</span>, <span class="sc">Stone-chats</span>, <span
  class="sc">Whin-chats</span>, and <span class="sc">Red-starts</span>. Small and prettily coloured
  species, these are all insect-eaters, and, with the exception of the wheat-ears, lay blue eggs,
  deposited in somewhat coarsely constructed nests, placed on or near the ground; or in holes in
  ruins, trees, or walls, in the case of the red-starts; or in burrows or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page538"><span class="smaller">{538}</span></span>under ledges of rock, as among the
  wheat-ears, which lay white eggs.</p>

  <p>The bird commonly known as the <span class="sc">Hedge-sparrow</span> is a close ally of the
  Thrush Family, having nothing to do with the sparrows proper&mdash;which are finches&mdash;as its
  name would imply.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Another nearly related form is the <span class="sc">Dipper</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Water-ouzel</span>. By no means brilliantly coloured, it is nevertheless an exceedingly
  interesting bird, and one never met with away from mountain streams. The group has a wide
  distribution, occurring in suitable localities in Europe, Asia, and the Rocky Mountains of
  America, and extending from Colombia to Peru and Tucuman. Squat in form, with rounded wings and
  short tail, the ouzel seeks the greater part of its food on the bottom of swiftly running streams.
  It is everywhere, writes Dr. Sharpe of the commoner of the two British species, a shy and watchful
  bird, and, except in the breeding-season, appears to be solitary. By patient watching near the
  dipper's haunts, however, it is possible to observe the bird scudding over the surface of the
  water with a rapid flight and a vigorous beating of the wings, something like that of a
  kingfisher, until it alights on a rock or large stone in the middle of the stream. Its white
  breast then stands out in bold relief, and, after pausing for a moment, the bird commences to edge
  to the side of the rock, and either walks deliberately into the water, or disappears suddenly
  beneath the surface, seeking its food at the bottom of the stream, in the shape of larv&aelig;,
  caddis-worms, water-beetles, and small snails.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Wrens</span> are probably near allies of the Dippers. The family includes
  a number of species of small birds, most largely represented in the New World, but distributed
  widely over the Old World also. Two occur in the British Islands: of these, one, the <span
  class="sc">Common Wren</span>, is found throughout Europe, and occurs also in Northern Africa,
  Asia Minor, and North Palestine; whilst the other, the <span class="sc">St. Kilda Wren</span>, is
  only found on the island from which it takes its name.</p>

  <p>Considerations of space compel us to pass over three or four families, of comparatively little
  interest to any save the scientific ornithologist, in favour of the <span
  class="sc">Fly-catchers</span> and <span class="sc">Swallows</span>.</p>

  <p>The former, in that the young are spotted, appear to evince some affinity to the Thrush Tribe,
  but they have broad and flatter bills than the latter, whilst the mouth is surrounded by more or
  less conspicuous bristles. They are entirely Old World forms, having their stronghold in
  Africa.</p>

  <p>Three species of fly-catcher occur in England, though only one, the <span
  class="sc">Common</span> or <span class="sc">Spotted Fly-catcher</span>, usually breeds in Great
  Britain, coming late in the spring from Africa. As its name implies, it feeds upon small insects,
  capturing them on the wing by sudden sallies, and returning immediately after to some perch,
  generally a garden-fence, or the bare bough of a tree. As a rule the prey is caught with a sudden
  dart, but sometimes only after a prolonged flight, when the bird will double and turn, as the
  necessity arises, with great skill. Its nest, <span class="pagenum" id="page539"><span
  class="smaller">{539}</span></span>made of dry grass and moss, lined with horse-hair and covered
  externally with spider-webs and lichens, is usually placed in some sheltered position, such as a
  crevice in the bark of a tree or in the creepers covering the trellis-work of a house; and owing
  to the skilful way in which it is covered externally, so as to resemble its surroundings, is
  difficult to find.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Swallows</span> and <span class="sc">Martins</span> constitute an
  exceedingly well-defined group of birds, and one which holds a conspicuously high place in the
  regard of mankind, finding a welcome everywhere on account of the great benefits they confer by
  the removal of insect-pests in the shape of the smaller gnats and flies. These, were they not kept
  in check by the Swallow Tribe, would render most parts of the world uninhabitable. Rarely seen
  upon the ground, save when procuring mud for the construction of their nests, the birds of this
  group are all peculiarly strong fliers, turning and twisting with the greatest speed and
  precision. All have very short beaks and wide mouths, long wings and tails, and small and weak
  feet.</p>

      <p class="sp0">In winter wrens have a custom of seeking some hole or other convenient shelter
      and huddling together in small parties for the sake of warmth.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A large number build their nests of mud, collected in small pellets and held together by the
  secretion of the salivary glands. These nests are commonly more or less cup-shaped, and fastened
  under the eaves of dwelling-houses or other buildings, or placed on a convenient beam or other
  ledge. The <span class="sc">Red-rumped Swallows</span> and <span class="sc">Fairy
  Martins</span>&mdash;species enjoying an enormous distribution, being found in India, Africa,
  America, and Australia&mdash;build very large flask-shaped nests, having the entrance produced
  into a funnel often eight or nine inches in length. Others, like the <span
  class="sc">Sand-martin</span>, excavate long tunnels, terminating in larger chambers, in the faces
  of sand-banks&mdash;a performance which must certainly be regarded as wonderful, when one realises
  the feeble tools with which the task of excavating has to be performed. Some species utilise the
  holes made by other birds, in one species this hole being itself bored within the burrow of the
  viscacha.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page540"><span class="smaller">{540}</span></span></div>

  <p>All are more or less migratory in their habits, some covering enormous distances in journeying
  to and fro between their winter retreats and their summer breeding-places. The <span
  class="sc">Common Swallow</span> and <span class="sc">House-martin</span>, for example, leave the
  shores of Africa early in the spring, and distribute themselves over Europe, thousands visiting
  the British Islands. After rearing in their respective breeding-places from two to three broods,
  they return with their offspring before the rigours of winter set in to the African Continent. The
  routes and destinations of the swallow are now well known; but as much cannot be said for the
  house-martin, whose winter quarters are as yet enshrouded in mystery. That they must be somewhere
  in Africa is all that can at present be said.</p>

  <p>Three species of the Swallow Tribe visit England regularly every year, and remain to breed.
  These are the <span class="sc">Common</span> or <span class="sc">Chimney-swallow</span>, and the
  <span class="sc">House-martin</span> just referred to, and the little <span
  class="sc">Sand-martin</span>. In the two first mentioned the upper-parts are of a dark steel-blue
  colour with a metallic gloss, but they are, nevertheless, easily distinguished one from
  another,&mdash;since the swallow has a deeply forked tail, and a bright chestnut patch on the
  throat, with a similarly coloured band across the forehead; whilst the martin lacks the chestnut
  markings, and is pure white beneath, with a large white patch on the lower part of the back, and a
  less markedly forked tail. Furthermore, the legs of the martin are feathered down to the claws,
  whilst the feet of the swallow are bare. The sand-martin is a little greyish-brown bird, with
  white under-parts. It is the earliest of the Swallow Tribe to arrive in Britain, and the first to
  depart.</p>

      swallow.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Lyre-birds and Scrub-birds.</span></p>

  <p>At the beginning of the account of the Perching-birds it was stated that the group was divided
  into two sections, and that each of these was further sub-divided into two. With the Swallows the
  first sub-division of the first section ended; the second we are to consider now in the very
  singular <span class="sc">Lyre-birds</span> and <span class="sc">Scrub-birds</span> of
  Australia.</p>

  <p>Rendered conspicuous on account of the remarkable lyrate tail, from which the name is derived,
  the <span class="sc">Lyre-birds</span>, on closer acquaintance, prove to be exceedingly
  interesting forms, though materials for a really complete biography of the three known species are
  not yet available. The males, it seems, are skilled mimics, reproducing the songs of other birds
  with great fidelity, this being especially true of the species known as <span class="sc">Prince
  Albert's Lyre-bird</span>. During the courting-season the males construct hillocks, to which they
  resort to display their very beautiful and graceful tails, elevating them over the head, and
  drooping the wings after the fashion of a peacock, accompanying this display with certain
  spasmodic pecking and scratching actions. They are solitary birds, more than a pair never being
  seen together, and even these are exceedingly difficult to approach, stratagem always being
  necessary. But a single egg is laid, which has the appearance of being smeared with ink; whilst
  the young bird differs from that of all other perching-birds in the thickness of its downy
  covering and the great length of time in which it remains in the nest. The nest, made of sticks,
  moss, and fibres skilfully interwoven, and lined inside with the leaf of a tree-fern which
  resembles horse-hair, is a large domed structure, with a single aperture serving as an
  entrance.</p>

  <p>Lyre-birds are essentially ground-dwellers, feeding upon insects, especially beetles and
  snails, and keeping to the wilder regions of the country.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page541"><span class="smaller">{541}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Scrub-bird</span> is an extremely interesting form, scientifically. Only
  the males are known at the present time, and these are dull-coloured birds of the size of a
  thrush. Of the female, eggs, and nest, we as yet know absolutely nothing.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Chatterers, Ant-thrushes, Broad-bills, etc.</span></p>

  <p>The second major division of the Perching-birds embraces a few forms of considerable
  interest.</p>

  <p>The group of <span class="sc">Chatterers</span> includes several remarkable forms of very
  diverse coloration, many representing the most gorgeous of all South American birds.</p>

      <p class="sp0">This photograph shows a portion of a sand bank, pierced with the tunnel-like
      nests made by these feeble builders.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the most remarkable is the <span class="sc">Umbrella-bird</span>. This bird is funereal
  in appearance, being clothed in a plumage of deep black, with the head surmounted by a large,
  drooping, flat-topped crest, resembling in shape the familiar crest of certain varieties of the
  canary, whilst from the throat hangs a long lappet of feathers reaching nearly down to the feet.
  The female is duller than her mate, and lacks the peculiar plumes. The umbrella-bird is a
  forest-dwelling species, confined to the Upper Amazons, and dwelling in the tops of the highest
  trees, where it finds ample sustenance in wild fruits. But few naturalists have ever seen it in a
  wild state.</p>

  <p>Equally wonderful are the <span class="sc">Bell-birds</span>, so called on account of their
  note, which bears an extraordinary resemblance to the sound made by a blacksmith upon an anvil,
  though it has often been likened to the tolling of a bell. Four species are known, in three of
  which the males have a pure white plumage, with much naked, vividly coloured skin on the face. One
  species has a curious pendulous process hanging from the forehead, thinly covered with feathers.
  By some this is said to be capable of erection during periods of excitement. Like the
  umbrella-bird, these are forest-dwelling species.</p>

  <p>For brilliancy of plumage amongst the Chatterers, the palm must be given to the <span
  class="sc">Cocks-of-the-rock</span>, in the males of which orange-red predominates, whilst the
  general effect is heightened by crests and curiously curled and frayed feathers growing from the
  lower part of the back. The males indulge in remarkable love-displays, the performances being held
  in some open space, and in the presence of the females. One at a time each male appears to go
  through a kind of dance, accompanying his peculiar steps and hops with much swaying of the head
  and extending of the wings. When tired, the performer gives a signal which is understood by his
  fellows, and retires from the ring, his place being immediately taken by another.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page542"><span class="smaller">{542}</span></span></div>

  <p>The nesting habits of the Chatterers vary greatly,&mdash;some building nests of mud and twigs,
  which they fasten on projections of rock in damp caves; others simply lining holes in trees with
  dry grass. Some build a cup-shaped nest of lichens, others a simple platform of sticks, whilst
  some of the <span class="sc">Thick-billed Chatterers</span> hang large nests of leaves,
  plant-stalks, and wool from low branches, the entrance to the nest being from a hole in the side.
  The eggs vary in number among the different species from two to four, and in colour may be white,
  chocolate, pale salmon-coloured, or greenish blue, and are for the most part spotted.</p>

  <p>The Manakin Family contains several species of considerable interest, on account of the
  peculiar modifications which certain of the quill-feathers of the males have undergone. In some
  species what are known as the secondary quill-feathers are peculiarly twisted, and have the shafts
  much thickened. With these modified feathers the birds are enabled, probably by clapping the wings
  and bringing the thickened feathers violently together, to make a sharp sound, which has been
  likened to the crack of a whip. Other species have the quill-feathers of the hand&mdash;the
  primaries, as they are called&mdash;similarly thickened, and they probably are also used to
  produce sounds.</p>

  <p>One species is known as the <span class="sc">Bailador</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Dancer</span>, on account of a very remarkable habit which the males have of dancing.
  Two males, choosing some secluded spot, select a bare twig, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page543"><span class="smaller">{543}</span></span>and, taking up a position about a foot and a
  half apart, alternately jump about two feet in the air, and alight again on exactly the same spot
  from which they sprang. With the regularity of clockwork one bird jumps up the instant the other
  alights, each bird performing a musical accompaniment to the tune of
  "to-le-do&mdash;to-le-do&mdash;to-le-do," uttering the syllable "to" as he crouches to spring,
  "le" while in the air, and "do" as he alights; and this performance appears to be kept up till the
  birds are exhausted.</p>

  short-tailed birds, of brilliant coloration, having their headquarters in the Malay Archipelago;
  but the family is represented in India, Australia, and West Africa.</p>

  <p>These birds are very shy and exceedingly difficult to approach. One species, the large <span
  class="sc">Ground-thrush</span>, is described by Wallace as one of the most beautiful birds of the
  East. Velvety black above, relieved by pure white, the shoulders are azure-blue and the belly a
  vivid crimson. The nest recalls, in the plan of its architecture, that of the Oven-birds, being
  more or less globular in form, and having a lateral entrance; it is composed of twigs, roots,
  bark, moss, leaves, and grass, and is frequently cemented with earth. The eggs are usually
  spotted, and have a creamy-white ground-colour: the spots may be brown, reddish grey, or purplish
  black.</p>

  <p>The curious <span class="sc">Plant-cutters</span> of the temperate regions of South America are
  nearly related to the Chatterers, though at one time it was believed they were allied to the True
  Finches. Constituting but a small family, the plant-cutters are remarkable for their strangely
  serrated beaks, the cutting-edges of which are armed with a series of fine saw-like teeth. This
  beak is used in cutting down plants; and as these birds appear to cut down a great number in sheer
  wantonness, they are much disliked in the neighbourhood of gardens and plantations.</p>

  <p>Plant-cutters are not conspicuous for the beauty of their plumage, and have a harsh and grating
  voice.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Wood-hewers</span> constitute a group of over 200 species, all of which
  are South American. They are for the most part small and dull-coloured birds, but nevertheless of
  considerable interest on account of their nest-building habits. The most remarkable members of the
  family in this respect are three species of <span class="sc">Oven-birds</span>. These construct a
  massive nest of mud, bearing a more or less fanciful resemblance to a baker's oven; hence the name
  Oven-bird. Roughly globular in shape, its walls are of great thickness, and to prevent cracking
  hair and grass-fibres are intermixed with the mud; the interior is gained through a small hole on
  one side of the nest, which leads into a passage terminating in a chamber containing the eggs,
  which are laid upon a bed of grass. Strangely enough, the bird seeks the most exposed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page544"><span class="smaller">{544}</span></span>situations, placing its nest
  on branches, in the forks of trees, on posts, rocks, or house-tops. Another species, known to the
  Spaniards as the <span class="sc">Casarita</span>, or <span class="sc">Little
  House-builder</span>, builds its nest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole, which is said to
  extend horizontally underground for nearly six feet. Other species build nests of sticks and twigs
  or of grass, which are divided into chambers after the fashion of the mud nest of the oven-bird,
  the inner chamber being lined with wool and feathers.</p>

  <p>The variation in the form, habits, and coloration of these birds is very great, some recalling
  the Woodpeckers and Tree-creepers, others the Titmice.</p>

  <p>The family of the <span class="sc">Tyrant Fly-catchers</span>, though numbering some 400
  species, is less interesting, or rather contains fewer peculiar forms, than the Manakin Family.
  The tyrant fly-catchers are American birds, and represent the fly-catchers of the Old World. One
  of the best known is the <span class="sc">King-bird</span>, which is renowned rather for its
  pugnacious disposition than for beauty of plumage.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Crested Tyrant-bird</span> has a curious habit of lining its nest with the
  cast-off skins of snakes, a habit which has caused a great deal of discomfort both to juvenile as
  well as adult egg-collectors, who, recognising the skin by the touch, have hurriedly withdrawn the
  hand, lest the owner of the cast-off coat should be in the vicinity.</p>

  </div>

  <p>All the tyrant-birds are active and restless in their habits, and frequent marshy districts,
  sitting alone, perched on the dead branches of trees or bushes, whence they dart forth like the
  Old World fly-catchers on their prey. Some species, however, frequent bare plains; others, also
  ground-dwellers, associate occasionally in flocks.</p>

  <p>Though the prey, which consists chiefly of insects, is, as a rule, captured on the wing, it is
  not invariably so. One species, for example, pounces down on crawling beetles, grasps them in its
  claws, and eats them on the ground. Some other species eat mice, young birds, snakes, frogs,
  fishes, spiders, and worms, the larger victims being beaten on a branch to kill them. One or two
  species will eat seeds and berries.</p>

  <p>The nest is often domed, and skilfully felted with moss, lichens, and spider-webs.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Broad-bills</span> are the sole representatives of the final sub-division
  of the Perching-birds. After the brilliant coloration, the next most striking feature is the great
  breadth of the bill. Their range is very limited, extending from the lower spurs of the Himalaya,
  through Burma and Siam, to Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. They seek the seclusion of forests in the
  neighbourhood of water, exhibiting great partiality for the banks of rivers and lakes, and feeding
  on worms and insects, many of the latter being captured on the wing.</p>

  <p>The nest of the broad-bill is a large and not very neat structure, oval in shape, with an
  entrance near the top, which is often protected with an overhanging roof. It is generally
  suspended from a low branch or plants near the water, and made of twigs, roots, and leaves, and
  lined with finer materials. From three to five eggs are laid.</p>

  <p>With these birds, probably the most primitive of the Perching-birds, this section ends. Many
  forms have inevitably been crowded out, whilst others have been but briefly noticed; nevertheless,
  all the really important groups have been more or less completely described, and in the majority
  of cases well illustrated.</p>

  <p>The Reptile Class, as defined by modern scientific limitations, includes among the living
  animals of the world the several groups of the Crocodiles, the Tortoises and Turtles, the Tuatera,
  the Lizards, and the Snakes. In the popular mind the Frogs and Toads, and the Newts and
  Salamanders, are often held to belong to the same main section; but these, as hereafter shown,
  claim, as Amphibians, an independent position of equivalent rank and value. In bygone geological
  ages the Reptile Class embraced a considerably larger number of groups; some of the members, such
  as the extinct Dinosaurs, comprised titanic monsters from 60 to 80 feet in length. The Crocodiles
  and Alligators of the present day are the only living reptiles which in any way approach the
  extinct Saurians in their dimensions, or assist us in some small measure to realise their unwieldy
  forms and bulk.</p>

  <p>The members of the Crocodile Order, which, in addition to the Alligators, includes also the
  Caimans and so-called Gavials or Garials, agree with one another in the more or less ponderous
  lizard-like shape of their body, supported on well-developed but short and comparatively weak
  legs, in their special adaptation to an amphibious existence, carnivorous habits, and restriction
  to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

      <p class="sp0">This species was worshipped with divine honours and mummified after death by
      the ancient Egyptians.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Among the salient characters of the <span class="sc">Crocodile</span>, as the representative of
  its tribe, which specially adapt it for its aquatic habits, the long, powerful tail is strongly
  compressed and thus fitted for use as an organ of propulsion, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page546"><span class="smaller">{546}</span></span>and the feet are more or less webbed. The
  most striking of its structural adaptations is, however, associated with the formation of the
  creature's skull. The manner in which a crocodile or alligator contrives to breathe or to save
  itself from asphyxiation, when opening and shutting its mouth under water, as it may often be
  observed to do in the Regent's Park Menagerie, is a common source of wonderment to the onlooker.
  This seemingly difficult feat is compassed by virtue of the posterior nostrils, or
  breathing-passages, being set so far back in the skull, and being so completely cut off from the
  mouth-cavity by specially developed bones of the palate, that they have no intercommunication with
  the mouth. It is this mechanism which enables a crocodile to seize and hold an animal underneath
  the water between its open jaws until it is drowned. Special valves at the back of the mouth
  prevent any water running down the creature's throat, while it is able itself to breathe
  unrestrainedly by allowing just the tip of its elongated snout, with the anterior
  nostril-apertures, to remain above the water's surface. In many species a conspicuous knob-like
  bony excrescence is developed at the extremity of the snout, by which the nostril-openings are
  raised turret-wise above the surface of the water. The eyes also being usually elevated above the
  level of the creature's head, the crocodile is able to approach its floating or bank-side prey
  practically unperceived, its huge body, limbs, and even the head, with the exception of the nose
  and eyes, being totally submerged.</p>

  <p>Although capable of moving with great activity in the water, crocodiles and their allies are
  usually accounted sluggish and slow movers on the land. Seen basking in the sun, as is their wont,
  by the hour together on some sand-bank, or creeping lazily thereon among their fellows, such a
  conclusion is natural. The celerity, however, with which <span class="pagenum" id="page547"><span
  class="smaller">{547}</span></span>even a huge 25-footer, as witnessed by the writer in the Norman
  River, North Queensland, will make tracks for and hurl itself into the water, if disturbed during
  its midday siesta by the near impact of a rifle-bullet, is a revelation. Crocodiles, moreover, as
  might be inferred from the slit-like contour of the eye-pupil, as shown by daylight, are to a
  large extent nocturnal, displaying their greatest activity, and being in the habit of travelling
  long distances along and away from the river-banks in search of food, or in connection with their
  migratory or mating instincts, under the cover of darkness.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of all living animals the crocodile and its allies are probably equipped most efficiently for
  both defence and aggression. The thick, horny shields, quadrangular on the back, tail, and
  under-surface, and adapted in shape and size to cover the head, limbs, and sides, constitute an
  almost impenetrable cuirass. As weapons of offence the formidable array of trenchant teeth, with
  which the powerful jaws are armed, have not alone to be reckoned with by the victim assailed. The
  crocodile's limbs and claws are relatively weak, and incapable of aggressive mischief; but in the
  long, compressed, muscular tail the reptile possesses a terribly effective weapon, wherewith, with
  one swift, unexpected side-stroke, it will sweep a smaller animal into the water, or deal a blow
  of sufficient power to fell or disable a man or bullock. Thus well-nigh invulnerable, and
  cognisant of its marvellous power of jaw and tail, a full-grown crocodile will not hesitate to try
  conclusions with even such puissant adversaries as the bear, the tiger, and other large carnivora,
  when they approach the river's brink to drink. Not infrequently, too, the crocodile comes off the
  victor in these contests; while, as sometimes happens, both of the well-matched foes are found
  dead side by side at the water's edge. The dread in which crocodiles are held by the natives of
  tropical countries, and the heavy toll they levy upon the riverside population, and more
  especially the women-folk in their accustomed avocations of water-carrying or laundry work, are
  too familiar to need dissertation. Hence it is that in every country, excepting those particular
  locations where the creature is a subject of misguided veneration or fetish worship, it may be
  said that every man's hand is against them, and the enmity most cordially reciprocated.</p>

  <p>All the members of the Crocodile Family propagate by egg-production. The eggs are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page548"><span class="smaller">{548}</span></span>relatively small in size,
  those of the largest species not exceeding that of a goose in dimensions. In shape they are more
  or less symmetrically ovate, and encased with a hard, white shell. In the case of the crocodile,
  the female selects a suitable dry sand-bank near the river's edge, in which it excavates a hole of
  about 2 feet deep, and, having deposited from twenty to sixty eggs therein, mounts guard over
  them, sleeping on top of the nest by day, until the young are hatched. With the alligator, the
  site chosen for the nest is more usually among bushes or reeds at some distance from the water,
  and the eggs, which may be laid to the number of over 100, are covered over with leaves and
  vegetable d&eacute;bris, whose decomposition engenders the heat required for their successful incubation.
  In both instances the parent jealously guards the nest and repels all intruders until the eggs are
  hatched, and ultimately conducts the young ones to the water, where they soon learn to shift for
  themselves. Numbers of them, nevertheless, in their young and weak state, fall victims to
  vultures, hawks, ichneumons, and all manner of birds and beasts of prey. From their birth the
  little saurians are most vicious and irascible in disposition, hissing and snapping at or laying
  hold with bull-dog tenacity of a finger or other seizable object that may be held towards them.
  From their earliest days also they are eminently aggressive and carnivorous. Contenting themselves
  at first with flies and other insects, they speedily extend their attentions to frogs, lizards,
  fish, or any small animals which frequent the marshes and river-banks; and finally, with their
  concurrently increased appetites and dimensions, requisition such larger prey as sheep, goats,
  deer, horses, and, as before mentioned, even the human species, if they can steal a march on them
  unawares. Crocodiles are provided with relatively small gullets, and are necessarily incapable of
  swallowing any prey whole which is of large dimensions. Accordingly any big quarry which is seized
  and dragged into the river is disposed of piecemeal, the reptile rending the carcase in fragments
  with the aid of its terrible teeth and side-wrenches of its ponderous body.</p>

  <p>Of crocodiles proper, as distinguished from alligators, there are some dozen known species.
  From their last-named near allies they are distinguished by the entire absence of the
  supplementary bony armature which in most alligators underlies the outer horny cuirass on the
  under surface of the body. A more essential distinction is associated with the character of the
  teeth. The upper and lower teeth of the crocodile interlock, and the fourth lower canine-like
  tooth is received into a notch in the side of the upper jaw, and is consequently more or less
  visible when the mouth is closed. In the alligators, on the other hand, this bigger tusk-like
  tooth fits into a pit-like excavation in the upper jaw, and is invisible when the mouth is
  shut.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">True Crocodiles</span> are found in the tropical regions of Africa, Asia,
  Australasia, and Central America. The largest is undoubtedly the estuarine species, ranging from
  the eastern shores of India, through the Malay region, to North and East Australia, New Guinea,
  and the Fiji Islands. This wide range is a natural concomitant of their brackish- and salt-water
  proclivities. Individuals of the species are, in fact, not infrequently met with floating on the
  sea at some considerable distance from the land. An example of this estuarine species has been
  recorded which measured no less than 33 feet, while a length of 20 feet and over is by no means of
  uncommon occurrence.</p>

  <p>The method adopted in Queensland and North Australia for capturing these destructive monsters
  is that of a running noose, so attached to a suitably flexible mangrove-tree growing in the
  vicinity of its nocturnal runs as to constitute a gigantic spring-trap. A dead carcase or other
  suitable bait is added to lure the animal to its doom. The crocodiles thus caught are alive and
  uninjured, and can be dispatched or reserved for menagerie exhibition. A somewhat amusing incident
  attended the transport of a "reprieved" captive by steamship from Cairns to Brisbane, Queensland,
  a few years since. In the dead of night, when all but the watch and engineer had retired to rest
  (they have to anchor and lay-to at night in the Great Barrier Reef channels), the saurian managed
  to free himself from his bonds, and started on a voyage of discovery around the decks. Arriving at
  the stoke-hold, he either incontinently stumbled into it, or descended of malice prepense,
  sniffing the chance of a supper or a good joke at the engineer's expense. Anyway, the engineer was
  aroused from his peaceful dozings with the impression that the last day of reckoning had arrived,
  and, rushing up the hatchway, awakened the whole ship's strength with his frantic outcries.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Nile Crocodile</span>, the most familiar form in European menageries, and
  once abundant throughout Egypt to the Nile's delta, has now retired to the upper reaches of that
  great river. It never attains to the dimensions of the estuarine form. By the ancient Egyptians,
  as is well known, this species was pampered and worshipped with divine honours while living, and
  after death embalmed and preserved in the catacombs.</p>

  Waterton, as all those familiar with his book of travels will remember.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The habits of the caiman differ somewhat locally. From the main stream of the Lower
  Amazon they are in the habit of migrating in the dry season to the inland pools and flooded
  forests. In the middle districts of the same river, where the drought is excessive and protracted,
  the caimans are addicted to burying themselves in the mud till the rains return; while in the
  upper reaches of the Amazon, where the droughts are not prolonged, the caimans are perennially
  present. The eggs of these reptiles are much esteemed for food by the natives of Dutch Guiana.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>TORTOISES AND TURTLES.</i></p>

  <p>The order of the Chelonians, including the Tortoises, Turtles, and Terrapins, with their
  allies, constitutes one of the most distinct and readily defined groups of the Reptile Class. The
  more or less complete bony shell, or carapace, which encases the body, and into which both head
  and limbs can in many cases be completely retracted, separates these reptiles very widely from the
  other orders. In some respects certain details of the skull-structure assimilate them to the
  Crocodiles; but here again there is an entire absence of the rows of formidable teeth, the upper
  and lower jaws being sharply pointed, covered with horn, and thus converted into a trenchant beak.
  The two leading groups of the Tortoises and the Turtles are distinctly separated, by the
  respective conformation of their limbs, for a terrestrial or aquatic existence. The Tortoises have
  normal walking-legs, with toes and, in most instances, claws, fitting them for walking on the land
  or burrowing into the earth. In the True Turtles <span class="pagenum" id="page552"><span
  class="smaller">{552}</span></span>these limbs take the form of flattened paddles, and in no
  instance are more than two of the toes provided with claws.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Tortoises</span> are sub-divided by zoologists into some six or eight
  subordinate groups or families, for the most part distinguished by the respective modifications of
  their protective shells. This shell in all tortoises and turtles consists of two essential
  elements&mdash;the upper or back casing, known as the "carapace," and the under one, or so-called
  "plastron," which covers the ventral surface. In some forms these two elements are completely
  welded into one another, forming a continuous box-like shell; in others they are more or less
  separate; while in yet another series the lower shell is rudimentary. These distinctions have been
  found to constitute a convenient basis for classification.</p>

  <p>Pre-eminent among this typical terrestrial series come the huge <span class="sc">Giant</span>
  or <span class="sc">Elephant-tortoises</span>, formerly abundant, as their fossil remains
  indicate, in Southern Europe, India, and North and South America, and now represented only in the
  isolated oceanic islands of Aldabra, off Madagascar, the Seychelles, and the Galapagos groups.
  Even within historic times they were very abundant in the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues; but
  their huge size and lethargic habits, combined with their esculent qualities, have brought about
  their extermination. Those remaining in the islands mentioned are now so reduced in numbers that
  there is a possibility of their becoming extinct at an early date, and this notwithstanding the
  strenuous endeavours that are being made to save them. A large percentage of the small residue of
  these giant Chelonians have been transported from their island homes and presented to the London
  Zoological Gardens, where they are now comfortably housed.</p>

  <p>An instructive idea of the aspect and relative dimensions of these giant tortoises may be
  obtained by a reference to page vii of the First Volume, in which one of these Chelonians is shown
  to be equal in size and strength to carrying a human rider. It is recorded that these reptiles
  were so abundant in the island of Rodrigues in 1691 that one might count as many as 3,000 of them
  in a single flock, and walk for over 100 paces upon their backs. All of these giant tortoises, as
  obtained from separate island groups, or islets of the groups, exhibit characteristic differences,
  indicating the length of time they have been separated from one another. The age to which these
  giant tortoises attain is altogether phenomenal. One example at Port Louis, Mauritius, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page553"><span class="smaller">{553}</span></span>originally brought from the
  Seychelles, is definitely known to have lived for over 130 years from the date of its
  transportation. It is stated to have been of large size when imported; and as these animals are
  notoriously slow growers, another couple of centuries may be safely added to its life-span. The
  Galapagos Islands down to recent times have produced the greater number of species of these
  tortoises, the carapace of the largest of these not infrequently measuring as much as 4 feet in
  direct length, and the weight of such an animal being over 400 lbs.</p>

  <p>Highly interesting details concerning the Galapagos giant tortoises and their habits are
  contained in Darwin's "Voyage of the Beagle." At the time of that illustrious naturalist's visit
  they were still very abundant in the islands. He remarked that they abounded in both the higher
  and damper and the lower and arid districts, but gave preference to the former. The old males were
  invariably the largest, growing to such a size that they required six or eight men to lift them,
  and yielded as much as 200 lbs. of good, highly nutritious meat. On some of the islands there was
  no water; and in these cases, as also when they occurred in the dry and arid lowlands, they were
  observed to feed chiefly on the succulent cactuses. When water was plentiful, the tortoises
  exhibited a great fondness for it, drinking large quantities and wallowing in the mud. In the
  larger islands, where wells and springs existed in the higher and damper portions, regular
  well-beaten paths radiated in every direction, indicating the routes, like sheep-tracks, regularly
  followed by the tortoises to and from the water-holes. It was these tracks which betrayed their
  presence and led to their first discovery by the older Spanish navigators. When travelling long
  distances to the watering-places, it is recorded that they march night and day, pursuing the "even
  tenor of their way" at the rate of sixty yards an hour&mdash;one yard per minute, or four miles
  per day! During the breeding-season the larger males indulge in hoarse roarings or bellowings that
  can be heard for a considerable distance. The female deposits her eggs either in the sand, where
  this is plentiful, covering them up <span class="pagenum" id="page554"><span
  class="smaller">{554}</span></span>again, or, where the ground is rocky, drops them
  indiscriminately in any crevice or depression encountered. The eggs are white, spherical, and
  hard-shelled, as in all tortoises, and somewhat exceed those of a hen in bulk.</p>

  <p>The very antithesis of the giant land-tortoises of the Galapagos Islands is the small and
  familiar <span class="sc">Grecian Tortoise</span>, frequently exposed for sale on hand-barrows in
  the London streets, and acquired by the unsophisticated suburban resident as a quaint but not
  altogether estimable garden pet. Like the majority of tortoises, this is a vegetarian, and with
  epicurean tastes that will guide it instinctively to select your choicest lettuces and the gems of
  your horticultural triumphs for the delectation of its fastidious appetite. The Grecian tortoise
  rarely exceeds 5&frac12; inches in length, and is abundant throughout South-eastern Europe, Sicily,
  Italy, and the Grecian Archipelago, extending thence to Syria. In Algeria an almost identical
  tortoise occurs which grows to the greater length of 9 inches; while Greece produces yet a third
  form, the so-called <span class="sc">Margined Tortoise</span>, which attains the greater length of
  11 inches, and is distinguished by the colour of the carapace usually being black, with a small
  spot of yellow on each shield-like plate. All three of the foregoing species are collectively
  imported by shiploads for sale in England, and it would be interesting to know what fate befalls
  them. In Greece and Sicily they are regularly placed on the market as an article of food. When
  acclimatised in England, and even in their warmer native country, these Grecian tortoises bury
  themselves in the earth and hibernate during the cold winter months.</p>

  <p>Next to the typical Land-tortoises the so-called <span class="sc">Hinged Tortoises</span>
  demand brief notice. The several members of this little group are denizens of tropical Africa, and
  notable for the circumstance that the hinder portion of their carapace is united with the anterior
  one by a movable ligamentous hinge. As a result of this peculiarity the animal, when retracted
  within its shell, can entirely close up the hinder aperture. None of these forms exceed a length
  of 9 inches.</p>

  <p>In another group, distinguished by the title of <span class="sc">Box-tortoises</span>, a
  ligamentous hinge is developed across the centre of the lower shell, or plastron, which, being
  freely movable with relation to the upper shell, enables the animal, when retracted, to completely
  close up both the anterior and posterior carapace apertures. The box-tortoises are natives of the
  South-eastern United States and Mexico, and, in addition to the foregoing structural peculiarity,
  are distinguished by the high or vaulted contour of their carapace. In some the toes are slightly
  webbed, and their habits are mainly carnivorous, indicating affinity with the flesh-eating and
  essentially aquatic Terrapins.</p>

  <p>Between the two, however, have been intercalated a little group, known as the <span
  class="sc">Pond-tortoises</span>, one species of which is found in Southern Europe, and a nearly
  allied one in North America. These pond-tortoises are distinguished by the smooth and depressed
  form of the carapace; the toes are fully webbed, fitting them for an aquatic life; while a
  ligamentous hinge, separating the anterior and posterior moieties of the plastron, enables them to
  cover in and protect their retracted head and limbs, after the manner of the Box-tortoises. The
  carapace of the European pond-tortoise does not exceed 7&frac12; inches in length, and is usually dark
  brown or black, ornamented with yellow dots or radiating streaks. This species inhabits both ponds
  and running water, and during the daytime creeps out on the banks, like the Crocodiles, to bask in
  the sun. As with the Crocodiles, however, the daytime does not represent the period of its
  greatest activity, this being during the night. The pond-tortoises are highly esteemed for the
  table in the countries where they are indigenous.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">True Terrapins</span> are all tortoises of essentially aquatic habits,
  differing, however, from the water-frequenting Pond-tortoises, last referred to, in that they have
  no ligamentous hinge providing for the hermetical closure of the carapace apertures. The carapace
  and plastron, moreover, are firmly united by bone, so that the two form conjointly a rigid,
  continuous shell, as in that of the typical Land-tortoises. The terrapins are widely distributed,
  being found in North America, Japan, China, the Persian Gulf, Spain, and North-west Africa.
  Terrapin ranks highly as a table delicacy in the United States. The real <span
  class="sc">Diamond-backed</span> species, however, is now becoming very scarce, the supply not
  being equal to the demand, and many inferior varieties being substituted in its place. The
  "fishing" for these terrapins is mainly prosecuted during the autumn months, when the reptiles
  become dormant, and are easily discovered and secured by probing the mud with sticks. The female
  terrapin, or "cow," as it is designated, is considered the greater delicacy, the eggs, to the
  number of twenty or thirty, usually found inside its body, being the <i>de rigueur</i> garnishing
  of the dainty dish. The diamond-terrapin rarely exceeds a length of 7 inches; but some of the
  inferior varieties, or "Sliders," as they are termed, are of much larger dimensions, and may weigh
  as much as 4 lbs.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The giant tortoises, like the relatively diminutive European varieties, are
      essentially herbivorous.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>From an &aelig;sthetic standpoint the <span class="sc">Painted Terrapin</span> undoubtedly bears the
  palm. Its smooth, depressed carapace is not more than 6 inches long, and its ground-colour is
  usually a dark olive-green, yellow lines bordering its component central shields; the small
  marginal shields are sometimes almost crimson with black markings, and the "bridge" uniting the
  carapace and plastron exhibits the same brilliant coloration. The soft skin of the head, neck, and
  other exposed parts have yellow and red bands on a brown or blackish ground-colour. This beautiful
  little terrapin, which is a special favourite for aquariums, is a native of Eastern North
  America.</p>

  <p>Passing the small and not peculiarly conspicuous group of the <span class="sc">American
  Mud-terrapins</span>, we arrive at the very distinctly differentiated family of the <span
  class="sc">Snappers</span>, <span class="sc">Snapping-turtles</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Alligator-terrapins</span>, as they are variously called. These likewise are
  exclusively confined in their present-day distribution to the New World, though in former ages
  allied species inhabited Europe. The alligator-terrapins are characterised by the relatively small
  size of the carapace, within which the animal is unable to completely retract its head and limbs,
  as in the preceding types. The head is relatively large, and armed with a formidable hooked beak;
  while the tail greatly exceeds in relative length that of any of the ordinary tortoises or
  terrapins, and is scaly and crested somewhat like that of a crocodile along its upper ridge, and
  has horny plates on the under-surface. Their popular name has, in fact, been conferred upon these
  Chelonians on the strength of their presenting the aspect to no inconsiderable <span
  class="pagenum" id="page557"><span class="smaller">{557}</span></span>extent of an alligator's
  body, to which the carapace of an ordinary terrapin has been united. The common
  alligator-terrapin, or snapping-turtle, is among aquatic Chelonians an animal of considerable
  size. The carapace alone may be as much or more than 20 inches long, and to this have to be added
  the thick head and neck and elongated tail, which, taken together, are of almost similar
  dimensions.</p>

  <p>A second closely related member of this family, known by the name of <span
  class="sc">Temminck's Snapper</span>, attains to yet longer proportions, and is the largest known
  river-tortoise. The carapace in this species may measure over 2 feet in length, and has three
  strongly marked longitudinal ridges. The head is relatively larger and the tail somewhat shorter
  than in the preceding species. It is a denizen of the southern districts of the United States,
  being met with in Texas, Florida, and as far north as the Missouri.</p>

  <p>The habits of the two species are stated to be identical. Both of them frequent the rivers and
  swamps of the areas indicated, preferring the waters that have a muddy bottom, and in some
  localities occurring in vast numbers. As a rule they prefer lying in deep water near the centre of
  the river or swamp they inhabit, but they also occasionally ascend to the surface and float in
  midstream with outstretched necks. Like other water-tortoises, they come on land to find suitable
  locations for depositing their eggs. The name of Snappers, commonly applied to these tortoises,
  bears reference to their inveterate habit of snapping and biting viciously at everything placed
  within their reach. Even from the egg the young of Temminck's species is wont to display this
  trait. The animals are somewhat esteemed for food, and are consequently caught for the market.
  They will take almost any bait, but manifest a predilection for fish. Considerable caution has
  necessarily to be exercised in dealing with them in the boats, and it is a common custom to
  decapitate them immediately they are hauled on board, otherwise they are capable of inflicting the
  most terrible wounds with their powerful cutting beaks on the persons of all or any who may remain
  within their reach. Bathing in waters tenanted by the pugnacious and distinctly aggressive
  snappers is a risky proceeding, and many cases of serious injuries that have happened to
  incautious adventurers in this direction have been recorded.</p>

  <p>The food of both the alligator and Temminck's snapper consists mainly of fish, and where common
  these tortoises must be ranked among the most potent agencies in denuding the rivers and lakes of
  their finny denizens. Not content with fish, the larger examples have been known to drag under
  water and devour such large water-fowl as ducks, and even geese. It is stated that the snappers
  exhibit a surprising amount of agility in the water, and swim after and capture the fish on which
  they feed. Such a feat seems scarcely credible of a bulky adult individual, while, moreover, it is
  provided with a remarkable and effective adaptation for taking its prey by stratagem. A very fine
  example of Temminck's snapper was for many years confined in a tank in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page558"><span class="smaller">{558}</span></span>Reptile-house in the Regent's Park
  Zoological Gardens. It usually lay prone at the bottom of its tank, giving little or no signs of
  life throughout the day, but was wont to display more activity and to move about its tank at
  night. At times, when ready for a fresh food-supply, it was observed that it would lie motionless
  as a stone, as usual, but with its mouth open to its widest gape. This attitude it would maintain
  for several hours together. The singularity of this action was that the gaping jaws displayed to
  view two elongate worm-like structures, which sprang close to one another from the floor of the
  mouth just within its entrance. These worm-like appendages were continually writhing to and fro,
  and presented in both aspect and movements a most remarkable resemblance to actual living worms.
  With this naturally provided decoy for fish there can be no need for the snapper to exhaust its
  energies in the strenuous pursuit of its quarry. To make the delusion complete, the head, neck,
  and chin of Temminck's snapper are decorated with small lobular or leaf-like membranous appendages
  resembling sponges or aquatic vegetation. The solid grey-brown triangular head of the animal
  itself might easily be mistaken for a piece of rock, and thus decorated with seemingly natural
  growths the unwary fish come browsing along it, rush upon the wriggling worms at the entrance of
  the cavernous chamber, and are lost. A photograph of this interesting Chelonian is reproduced on
  page <a href="#page560">560</a>, which depicts it with its mouth open, and indicates both the
  position and the presence of the worm-like decoy-appendages.</p>

  <p>There are several water-tortoises presenting a considerable external resemblance to the forms
  already noticed which belong to distinct family groups. Thus the <span class="sc">Matamata
  Tortoise</span> of Northern Brazil has at first sight, except for its short tail and nose-like
  proboscis, much in common with Temminck's snapper. Fimbriated and foliaceous membranous outgrowths

  <p>The so-called <span class="sc">Snake-necked Water-tortoises</span> of South America, and the
  <span class="sc">Long-necked</span> aquatic ones of Australasia, possess modifications of
  skull-structure and other details that indicate family distinctness. A broad external character
  that serves to separate this group from the Terrapins and all preceding forms is that the neck,
  when drawn within the cavity of the carapace, is not flexed in the form of the letter <span
  class="sans fwb">S</span>, but simply bent sideways along the anterior margin of the body. The
  species belonging to this group, which includes the Matamata, Snake-necked, and Soft-shelled
  Water-tortoises, and also a few essentially terrestrial species, are distinguished collectively by
  the appellation of the <span class="sc">"Side-necked"</span> Tortoises.</p>

  <p>Certain of the Terrapins, or Water-tortoises, belonging to the groups above described frequent
  saline river-estuaries and salt marshes, but none are strictly marine. With the Turtle Family,
  however, we arrive at an exclusively pelagic section, in which the animals are specially adapted
  for life in the high seas, the walking-limbs of the terrestrial and fresh-water species being
  replaced by long and powerful swimming-flippers. The shell in these marine Chelonians is more or
  less heart-shaped and flattened, and the carapace and plastron are always separate, and never
  united in a rigid box-like form, as with the Land-tortoises. In common with those fresh-water
  tortoises which pass the greater portion of their existence in lakes or rivers, the <span
  class="sc">Marine Turtles</span> resort to the land to deposit their eggs. The locations chosen
  are the sand-beaches or isolated sandy islets in tropical oceans, wherein, after excavating
  hollows to receive them, the eggs are covered up and left to hatch with the heat of the sun. The
  eggs of turtles differ from those of the Land-tortoises and Terrapins in that their external
  covering is soft or leathery. So soon as the young turtles are hatched, they emerge from the sand,
  and instinctively make their way to the water. Many, however, are the perils that beset their
  course, and few there be out of perhaps 80 or 100 turtlets which gain the shore and get through
  into deep water. Fish-hawks and sea-birds of every description are waiting ready to pounce down
  upon them immediately they make their appearance, or to thin their ranks as they run the gauntlet
  of perhaps 100 yards or so to reach the sea in safety. Even at the waters edge the ordeal is by no
  means passed. Shoals of the smaller sharks and other predatory fish are continually cruising round
  in the shallow water, and have as high an appreciation of the toothsomeness of tender turtle as
  the proverbial London alderman. The writer was fortunate on one occasion, among the coral islands
  on the Australian coasts, to light upon a young turtle brood <span class="pagenum"
  id="page560"><span class="smaller">{560}</span></span>just emerging from their sandy nest. The
  majority were assisted to the sea, and a few, reserved in the interests of science, were liberated
  in a bath of sea-water to have their first swim. Snapshot photographs were taken, one of which,
  reproduced on page <a href="#page561">561</a>, serves to illustrate the great relative length of
  the paddle-like limbs at this early stage and the variety of postures assumed during natation.</p>

  <p>Of the typical Marine Turtles three distinctly characterised species are recognised by
  zoologists. These are the <span class="sc">Green Turtle</span>, indispensable for soup at
  aldermanic banquets; the <span class="sc">Hawksbill</span>, or tortoiseshell-producing turtle; and
  the <span class="sc">Loggerhead</span>. Of these three, the green turtle and the loggerhead more
  nearly resemble one another, and are apt to be confounded by the uninitiated. Such an error is
  very readily detected when the Chelonian comes to the table, the flesh of the loggerhead being
  rank and utterly unfit for food. In order, however, to be wise before the event, and to avoid a
  grievous misdirection of culinary energy&mdash;turtle being a standard dish in the coral
  seas&mdash;it is only necessary to count the number of large shield-like plates that flank each
  side of the central series in the creature's carapace. In the true green or edible turtle there
  are only four pairs of these large lateral shields, while in the loggerhead there are never less
  than five, and sometimes more. The loggerhead-turtle also, as its name implies, has a
  conspicuously larger and coarser head than the esculent species. The fact that while the green
  turtle is a strict vegetarian, feeding entirely on seaweeds, the loggerhead is altogether
  carnivorous, readily accounts for the diametrically diverse gastronomic properties of these two
  Chelonians. Both species attain to a considerable size, over 3 feet in length (the loggerhead
  being the larger), and are found inhabiting the same waters throughout the tropics.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Hawksbill</span>, or true tortoiseshell-producing turtle, never attains to
  quite as large dimensions as the two preceding species, though its carapace may measure as much as
  2 feet 6 or 8 inches long. The structural feature that at once distinguishes the hawksbill from
  either the green or loggerhead species is the character of the horny shields developed on the
  surface of the carapace. Instead of the edges meeting in juxtaposition, as in those two forms,
  they overlap one another, like the scales of a fish, and are notable for their thickness and their
  exceedingly beautiful but variably marbled patterns. It is these marbled horny plates which
  constitute the tortoise-shell of commerce. In young individuals the substance is thin and very
  transparent, but thickens with advancing age, until in old individuals the plates may vary from
  &#x215B; to &frac14; inch in thickness. Like the two preceding species, the hawksbill, within tropical
  seas, enjoys a cosmopolitan distribution. Its habits, like the loggerhead's, are essentially
  carnivorous; but while the flesh is coarse and rank, the eggs are valued for the table.</p>

  <p>A remaining member of the Marine Turtle series is the so-called <span class="sc">Luth</span> or
  <span class="sc">Leathery Turtle</span>. This Chelonian differs so materially in structure from
  the foregoing species as to be referred to a distinct family. The horny plates, so conspicuous in
  all the other types, are entirely absent, the bony carapace, which is distinctly seven-ridged
  longitudinally, being covered with a homogeneous leather-like skin. Both jaws are formidably
  hooked and cutting throughout their edges, and the paddles are destitute of the two rudimentary
  claws found in the preceding species. The leathery turtle grows to an immense size; specimens
  <span class="pagenum" id="page561"><span class="smaller">{561}</span></span>have been recorded
  measuring as much as 8 feet in total length and weighing over 1,600 lbs. Its flesh is not only
  unfit for food, but is reported to be of a poisonous character. The coasts of Florida and Brazil
  are among the areas where the leathery turtle is met with in the greatest abundance.</p>

  <p>The more ordinary method of capturing turtle for the market or to supply the deficiencies of
  the larder aboard ship in tropical climates is to land at night, preferably when the moon is full,
  on the islands to which the females are in the habit of repairing to deposit their eggs. This
  function is invariably discharged during the night hours, and unless the moon is up the presence
  of the reptiles is not easily determined. Time is generally given for the turtle to excavate its
  sand-burrow and lay its eggs, usually over a hundred in number, the proper moment for the capture
  being that when, the task accomplished, it sets forth to regain its more accustomed element. The
  creature is then seized and turned suddenly upon its back, where it is left to struggle and
  flounder helplessly, being perfectly incapable of righting itself, while other captures are made.
  On outlying coral islands, such as those of the Lacepedes, off the Western Australian coast,
  several dozen of the Chelonians may represent one good night's haul, the choice of the fittest
  examples being left until the return of daylight.</p>

  <p>In many places turtles are pursued in the water and speared; while in some locations, notably
  at Keeling Island, as recorded by Darwin, the animals are chased by the natives in sailing-craft.
  One man steers the boat, the other one standing in the bows on the look-out for turtle. A
  Chelonian being sighted, an exciting stern chase ensues, and on coming abreast with the quarry the
  look-out man plunges into the water straight upon the turtle's back, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page562"><span class="smaller">{562}</span></span>clings pertinaciously with both hands to the
  shell of the neck until the creature is exhausted, when it is dragged into the boat.</p>

      <p class="sp0">In common with many other water-tortoises, or terrapins, this species is
      essentially gregarious in its habits.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The most remarkable method of taking turtle, however, is that practised in Torres Straits, as
  also at Mozambique and formerly in the West Indies. The sucking-fish, or remora, is in this case
  impressed into the service of the human fishers. Taking advantage of the fish's natural propensity
  to swim towards and adhere pertinaciously to any larger floating object, fishermen go out with
  specimens kept alive in a small well in the bottom of their boats. When in pursuit of turtle, a
  long light line is attached to the fish's tail; and coming within sight of a Chelonian, the fish,
  with an abundance of slack or pay-out line, is thrown in the direction of the turtle. The remora
  immediately swims towards and adheres firmly to the under surface of the shell of the turtle, when
  it will suffer its body to be torn asunder rather than let go its hold of its newly gained
  sanctuary. Should the turtle be a small one, both fish and turtle are dragged with the line back
  to the boat. If, on the other hand, it is of large size, one of the natives plunges into the
  water, and, following the line down, secures the turtle.</p>

  <p class="sp5">In the island of Ascension the cultivation and breeding of turtles for exportation
  in artificially constructed enclosures have for a considerable time been the subject of an
  important industry. There are doubtless many other locations on both the Australian coast-line and
  in the British West Indies where this highly profitable trade could be established. In addition to
  the green turtle, attention might also be profitably directed at the same locations to the culture
  of the tortoiseshell-bearing species. Tortoiseshell possesses the singular and useful property of
  being susceptible of perfect amalgamation. Consequently a number of small-sized pieces can be
  welded so indistinguishably with one another as to serve the same use as the larger plates for
  commercial purposes. This amalgamation is effected by bevelling the edges of the two pieces that
  it is desired to unite along the proposed line of junction, and then, while they are held in
  juxtaposition in a metallic press, submitting them to the action of boiling water.</p>

  <p>The Lizard Tribe or Sub-order is notable as containing a greater number of specific forms than
  any other of the Reptilian groups, no less than 1,700 distinct species being described in the most
  recently published catalogues. While formerly regarded as constituting a separate and independent
  order of the Reptile Class, later investigations have demonstrated that lizards are so intimately
  related through sundry intermediate types with the Snakes that they cannot be recognised as
  constituting other than a sub-section of the same order. The two groups of the Lizards and Snakes
  are consequently, and with reference more particularly to their commonly shared scaly armatures,
  technically distinguished by the appellation of Scaled Reptiles.</p>

  <p>While the more typical members of the Lizard Tribe are readily distinguished from the Snakes by
  the possession of well-developed limbs, a not inconsiderable number of species are altogether
  devoid of these appendages, or possess them only in a partially developed or rudimentary
  condition. The <span class="sc">British Blind-worm</span>, or <span class="sc">Slow-worm</span>,
  constitutes an example of such a legless lizard, although on account of its outward snake-like
  appearance it is commonly regarded as a snake by the uneducated. In the South European so-called
  <span class="sc">Glass-snake</span>, or <span class="sc">Scheltopusik</span>, here figured, the
  snake-like aspect and creeping habits are still more conspicuous, but yet when examined more
  critically its lizard affinities become apparent. One of the most readily apprehended external
  characters that serve to distinguish this and the majority of the legless lizards from snakes is
  the possession by the former of movable eyelids and conspicuous external ear-openings. Among
  snakes eyelids are invariably absent, the <span class="pagenum" id="page564"><span
  class="smaller">{564}</span></span>eyes, by way of compensation, being covered by transparent
  horny plates, which impart to these creatures that peculiar stony stare which undoubtedly
  constitutes one of the most repulsive features of their tribe. There are, however, a few
  exceptional lizards devoid of eyelids, though these species do not take a snake-like form.</p>

  <p>The first position among the Lizard Tribe is usually accorded to the <span class="sc">Gecko
  Family</span>&mdash;a group numbering 280 species, which present several somewhat anomalous
  features and characteristics. In the first place, in contradistinction to the majority of lizard
  forms, they are for the most part nocturnal in their habits, and have their eyes specially
  modified to meet them. Geckos, as the exception to the ordinary lizards previously referred to,
  possess no eyelids, and the pupil of the eye, as seen in broad daylight, is mostly represented by
  a narrow vertical slit, like that of a cat or a nocturnal dog-fish. As the night approaches,
  however, the membranous diaphragm is retracted, displaying to view a symmetrically orbicular pupil
  of abnormal size and luminosity. Another prominent characteristic of the geckos is the peculiar
  modification of their feet, which in most instances are furnished with adhesive disks or pads,
  which enable these lizards to run with ease, after the manner of flies, on the smooth surface of a
  wall or window-pane, or even along the ceiling. It is further noteworthy of the geckos that they
  are the only lizards which possess the power of emitting <span class="pagenum" id="page565"><span
  class="smaller">{565}</span></span>distinct vocal sounds. The name Gecko is, in point of fact,
  derived from the fancied resemblance to the word that constitutes the shrill, somewhat bird-like
  note of one of the most familiar species. "Tok," "toki," "chick, chick," "checko," and "tocktoo"
  are distinctive call-notes that are respectively associated with other members of the Gecko
  Family.</p>

      regrowing its recently amputated tail. These geckos often travel from Madeira to Covent Garden
      Market among banana bunches.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The geckos are most numerously represented in the Indian and Australasian regions. None of them
  attain to large dimensions. They rarely exceed 1 foot in total length, and most frequently measure
  some 3 or 4 inches only.</p>

  <p>Geckos, in common with many other lizards, are notable for the facility with which their tail
  becomes detached and left in the hands of their would-be captor. In course of time a new tail
  sprouts out from the truncated stump of the original member, and within a few more months equals
  it in dimensions. It not infrequently happens that two or even three new tail-sprouts take the
  place of the original appendage, imparting to the little creature a most bizarre appearance. The
  above photograph includes an example of the Madeiran species in which a new tail-bud of a normal
  character has just commenced to grow.</p>

  <p>The nearest approach to the phenomenon of flight among lizards occurs in what are known as the
  <span class="sc">Flying-dragons</span>, belonging to the family of the Agamas, which next invites
  attention. These lizards are all of relatively small size, not exceeding a few inches in length,
  and inhabit the Indo-Malayan region. In these singularly specialised forms six or seven of the
  posterior ribs are abnormally produced on each side of the body, and so united together by thin,
  semi-transparent membrane as to form a pair of wing-like expansions. When not in use, these
  structures are folded, after the manner of a fan, closely against the animal's sides, while, when
  extended, they constitute a most effective parachute, wherewith the little creatures accomplish
  flying leaps from tree to tree, after the manner of the Flying-squirrels and Phalangers. The <span
  class="pagenum" id="page566"><span class="smaller">{566}</span></span>colour of these wing-like
  structures varies among the many different specific forms, being in some instances spotted or
  reticulated like those of a butterfly.</p>

  <p>This same family of the Agamoid Lizards includes a number of species of very dissimilar aspect
  and habits, which are almost exclusively confined to the Old World or Oriental zoological region.
  Australia in particular is remarkably rich in representatives of this group, many of them of
  considerable size. Certain of these have within recent years been found to be endowed with the
  power of bipedal locomotion. The <span class="sc">Frilled Lizard</span> of Queensland and the
  northern territories of Western Australia was the first species in which this bipedal habit was
  authentically demonstrated in connection with examples observed in Australia and also brought to
  England by the writer, one of the last-named examples furnishing the photographs reproduced on
  page <a href="#page567">567</a>. In other respects this lizard is one of the most remarkable of
  its tribe. The peculiar Elizabethan collar-like frill, capable of erection or depression at the
  creature's will, imparts to it a most singular appearance. When at rest or undisturbed, this
  membranous frill-like structure is folded down in neat, symmetrical pleats around the lizard's
  neck. Should the creature be approached by man or dog or other aggressive animal, the mouth
  springs open to its widest, and simultaneously with this action the frill is erected like the
  sudden opening of an umbrella, and stands out at right angles around the neck, imparting to it a
  most formidable and threatening aspect. Dogs, in fact, which will habitually chase and kill larger
  lizards, such as the Monitors, will frequently halt and retire discomfited when confronted with a
  frilled lizard at bay with its frill erected. The brilliant colour of this frill, more especially
  in the male, adds very considerably to the formidable appearance of this lizard. While the body of
  this lizard is usually of a light brown colour, with more or less distinct darker transverse bars
  and reticulations, the frill-like membrane has a ground-colour in which orange and chrome-yellow
  chiefly predominate, and upon which are superimposed splashings and speckles of brilliant scarlet.
  While the total length of this averages 2 feet, the expanded frill in adult males is not
  infrequently as much as 8 or 9 inches in diameter. The peculiar, grotesquely human aspect
  presented by the frilled lizard when running on its hind legs only will be appreciated on
  reference to the accompanying photographs. This erect attitude is only assumed when the frilled
  lizard is traversing more or less considerable distances and moving on level ground. Under other
  circumstances it progresses on all-fours, after the manner of the ordinary members of its
  class.</p>

  <p>Several other lizards belonging to the family group of the Agamas have been demonstrated by the
  writer to move in the same manner as the frilled species. <span class="sc">Leseur's
  Water-lizard</span>, also a Queensland form, which attains to a length of 3 or 4 feet, is a
  notable example in this connection. As implied by its name, it is semi-aquatic in its habits. It
  frequents scrubs in the neighbourhood of river-banks and backwaters, and passes a considerable
  portion of its time in shallow water with only its nostrils elevated above the surface. It is a
  most expert swimmer, sculling itself with grace and rapidity, aided only by its long, laterally
  compressed tail. Examples brought to England and kept alive for some years by the writer were
  observed, in hot weather more particularly, to sleep at nights in their water-tanks.</p>

      <p class="sp3">AUSTRALIAN TREE-LIZARD.</p>
      <p class="sp0">This species also runs on its hind legs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The several instances of bipedal locomotion among living lizards, as here chronicled, are of
  especial interest in correlation with the circumstance that certain extinct Dinosaurs habitually
  progressed on their hind limbs only. They, in fact, have left "footprints on the sands of time"
  which indubitably prove this assumption. There is, however, no relationship between the two
  groups, and the resemblance is one of pure analogy, just as both bats and birds fly, although they
  have no kinship.</p>

  <p>Among other interesting lizards included in the Agama Family, mention may be made of the
  singular <span class="sc">Jew</span> or <span class="sc">Bearded Lizard</span> of
  Australia&mdash;a flattened, broad-set form, some 14 or 15 inches long, brown in hue, and clothed
  with rough imbricated scales, but whose chief peculiarity consists of the expansive beard-like
  development of the cuticle immediately underneath the animal's chin. As in the frilled lizard,
  this cuticular excrescence is only conspicuous when the creature is excited, at other times being
  contracted and indistinguishable from an ordinary skin-fold. When retiring to rest, these lizards,
  in their adult state, almost invariably climb up and cling to the rough bark of a convenient tree,
  and when young and more slender will also ascend saplings, on which they sleep, clinging by their
  interlocked claws.</p>

  <p>Another member of the Agama Family which invites brief notice is the so-called <span
  class="sc">York Devil</span>, or <span class="sc">Mountain-devil</span>, of Western and Central
  Australia. This lizard is of comparatively small size, rarely exceeding 6 or 7 inches in length.
  Its feeble form and stature, however, are abundantly compensated for by the complex panoply of
  spines and prickles by which its head and limbs and body are effectually protected. The natural
  food of this singular lizard consists exclusively of ants, the small black, evil-smelling species
  which often proves itself a pest by its invasion of the Australian colonists' houses being its
  prime favourite. These are picked up one by one by the rapid flash-like protrusion and retraction
  of the little creature's adhesive tongue, and the number of ants which are thus assimilated by a
  Moloch lizard at a single meal is somewhat astonishing. A number of examples of this species were
  kept by the writer in Australia, and their gastronomic requirements fully satisfied <span
  class="pagenum" id="page569"><span class="smaller">{569}</span></span>every day by taking them
  into the garden and placing them in communication with a swarming ant-track. By careful
  observation it was found that no less than from 1,000 to 1,500 ants were devoured by each lizard
  at a single sitting. The ant-devouring proclivities of these prickly little lizards can no doubt
  be turned to very useful and effective account in clearing ant-infested domiciles, and were in
  fact thus utilised by the writer on more than one occasion.</p>

  <p>The lizards included in the Agama Family are essentially inhabitants of the Eastern Hemisphere,
  none occurring in America. In the western continent, however, we find an equally extensive but
  structurally distinct group which presents many singularly corresponding types. This family
  comprises the true <span class="sc">Iguanas</span>, many of them of considerable size, and a
  numerous assemblage of smaller forms. Among those species which present a striking parallel in
  size and aspect to the peculiarly characteristic Old World Agamas, mention may be made of the
  little so-called <span class="sc">Horned Toad</span>, or <span class="sc">Spiny Lizard</span>, of
  California and other of the North American States. This species might readily be taken by the
  uninitiated for a near relation of the Australian Moloch Lizard, or Mountain-devil, last
  described, its flattened diminutive form and bristling spiny armature seemingly justifying such a
  supposition. The crucial test afforded by the character of the dentition, however, distinctly
  indicates its true position to be with the Iguanas. In the Agamas the teeth are invariably
  developed from the apex, or summit, of the jaw. These teeth, moreover, are varied in character. In
  the Iguanas, on the other hand, the teeth are all more or less uniform in character, and are
  attached to the outer sides of the jaw.</p>

  <p>The larger iguanas are, for the most part, exclusively fruit- and vegetable-feeders, and
  arboreal in their habits. The thick forest scrubs in the vicinity of streams and rivers are their
  favourite resort. After the manner of the Australian water-lizards, these iguanas are expert
  swimmers, and delight in lying along the overhanging branches, whence at the slightest alarm they
  can precipitate themselves into the water beneath. When swimming, the fore limbs are folded back
  against the sides, the tail only being used as a means of propulsion. Several of the larger
  iguanas, such as the common or tuberculated <span class="pagenum" id="page570"><span
  class="smaller">{570}</span></span>species, attain to a considerable length, 5 or 6 feet; their
  bodies are proportionably thick, and the white flesh, in this last-named variety more
  particularly, is highly esteemed as a table delicacy. The common <span class="sc">Tuberculated
  Iguana</span> is an essentially handsome species, its skin being variegated with bands and
  shadings of brown and green, which are lightest and brightest in the males and younger
  individuals; the neck and snout and jaws are decorated with projecting, rounded tubercles; a
  large, baggy, dewlap-like membrane, capable of inflation at the animal's will, depends from the
  chin and throat; and a deeply serrated crest of elevated scales extends from behind the head, down
  the centre of the back, nearly to the extremity of the tail.</p>

  <p>The Iguana Family includes a species with essentially marine proclivities, this being the <span
  class="sc">Galapagos Sea-lizard</span>. This animal was first discovered to science by the late
  Mr. Charles Darwin, who found it in considerable numbers on the shores of the islands which
  constitute the Galapagos group. The lizards were observed to spend much of their time swimming in
  the sea, but at no very great distance from the land. Experiments proved that they could live for
  a very considerable interval entirely submerged, examples sunk with weights for as much as an hour
  emerging entirely unaffected from the ordeal.</p>

  <p>While the Iguanas may be described as essentially American, one or two exceptional forms are
  found inhabiting the relatively remote regions of the Fiji Islands and Madagascar. The so-called
  <span class="sc">Fiji Banded Iguana</span> (photographs of a pair of which, once in the writer's
  possession, are reproduced on page <a href="#page575">575</a>) is a very beautiful creature. The
  body is shapely and well proportioned, and terminates in a tail of abnormal length&mdash;equal to
  quite twice that of the body&mdash;the entire dimensions measuring some 3 feet. The male is much
  more bright in hue than the female; for while the latter is usually of a uniform light green
  throughout, the male is variegated, with broad, alternating bands of brightest <span
  class="pagenum" id="page571"><span class="smaller">{571}</span></span>emerald-green and pale
  French grey. Around the lips and eyes there are lines of brightest yellow, and the throat is
  almost pure white.</p>

  <p>The small group of <span class="sc">Girdle-tailed Lizards</span> belongs exclusively to the
  African and Madagascan regions, its typical representative being the Cape and Orange River Colony
  species, illustrated on page <a href="#page575">575</a>. The symmetrical whorls of long, spinous
  scales encircling the tail in this and the allied forms constitute a prominent feature, and have
  originated the popular name of Girdle-tails.</p>

  <p>The most aberrant representatives of the Lizard Tribe, with regard to one very important
  characteristic, are undoubtedly the two species of <span class="sc">Heloderm</span>, or "<span
  class="sc">Silatica</span>," as they are called by the natives. These reptiles (page <a
  href="#page576">576</a>) occupy the unenviable position of being the only known lizards which
  possess poisonous properties, their bite having been demonstrated to be fatal to smaller mammals,
  and to be attended by very serious symptoms in the case of human subjects being bitten. The more
  common <span class="sc">Mexican Heloderm</span> has been in residence at the Zoo for many years;
  it attains to a length of from 18 to 20 inches, and its stout, squat body, short limbs, warty
  skin, and peculiar colouring are calculated at first sight to awaken a feeling of revulsion in the
  beholder. Like the wasp, the salamander, and other animals whose conspicuous tints indicate their
  poisonous or other baneful properties, the heloderm is distinguished by a lurid ground-colour,
  varying in individuals from yellow-orange to flesh-pink, upon which are superimposed bold,
  network-like markings of blue-black or dark brown tints. Along the tail these reticulations
  usually take the form of more or less irregular rings.</p>

  <p>Although the heloderms possess such deadly properties, those at the Zoo manifest a by no means
  aggressive disposition, and allow their keeper or even strangers to handle them with impunity. In
  experiments purposely made to substantiate or refute the previously current rumours as to the
  poisonous nature of these animals, two guinea-pigs succumbed to bites received in the course of
  the day. The owner of the reptiles, who was also bitten on one occasion through incautiously
  handling, suffered very severe, though happily not fatal, effects. In connection with its
  poison-dealing properties it is found that it possesses certain long and fang-like teeth, which
  are set loosely in the jaws, and which have grooves before and behind for the transmission of the
  poison, which is secreted by special glands situated close to their base. The favourite habitat of
  <span class="pagenum" id="page572"><span class="smaller">{572}</span></span>the heloderm is the
  arid, sandy, and stony region on the western side of the Cordillera mountain-range. It is at the
  same time said to be rarely seen in those parts except during the rainy season, and also to be for
  the most part nocturnal in its habits.</p>

  <p>The family group of the <span class="sc">Monitors</span> includes the largest of existing
  lizards, notably the semi-aquatic form common to North Australia and the Malay Peninsula and
  adjacent islands, which attains a length of 8 or 10 feet, and is not infrequently mistaken, as it
  rushes, on being disturbed, through the reeds and other rank herbage to the water, for a young
  crocodile. An exceedingly fine and well set-up example of these huge water-monitors, shot by
  Captain Stanley Flower in the neighbourhood of Singapore, is placed in the Reptile Gallery of the
  Natural History Museum.</p>

  <p>Another species, indigenous to the Southern Australian States, and having essentially arboreal
  habits, commonly attains to a length of 5 or 6 feet. The skin of one example of this species,
  obtained for the writer from the eucalyptus forests in Gippsland, Victoria, measures no less than
  7 feet long. With reference to the elegant lace-like pattern of its skin-markings, this species is
  frequently associated with the suggestive title of the <span class="sc">Lace-lizard</span>. Among
  the more illiterate settlers it is generally known as a Gooana, the name being obviously a
  corruption of Iguana, and being, as a matter of fact, applied promiscuously, and in all cases
  incorrectly, to a number of the larger Australian lizards.</p>

  <p>All the members of the Monitor Tribe are inveterate egg-eaters. An Egyptian species, the <span
  class="sc">Nile Monitor</span>, renders service to humanity through the gratification of this
  propensity in seeking out and devouring the eggs of the crocodile. The larger water-monitor of the
  North Australian and Malay regions has been reported to the writer to be particularly partial to
  the eggs of the turtle, digging them out of the sand in which the parent deposits them, and
  destroying them wholesale. The more strictly arboreal Southern Australian species preys to a very
  large extent on birds' eggs, climbing to the holes in the trunks and branches in which so many
  Australian birds build their nests, and not infrequently capturing and devouring also the parent
  birds and young. In the "bush" settlements this monitor is notorious for its depredations among
  the hen-roosts, both eggs and young chickens falling victims to its insatiable appetite. It is
  consequently regarded with but scant favour <span class="pagenum" id="page573"><span
  class="smaller">{573}</span></span>by poultry-farmers, who frequently organise a "gooana" hunt for
  its special destruction. If surprised out in the open, the quarry at once rushes for a tree, and
  manifests the most remarkable agility in "swarming" up the smooth, massive trunk, and in dodging
  round to the side opposite to that on which the sportsman approaches. Not infrequently, trees
  being remote, the monitor will make for what appears to its apprehension the best substitute for
  one&mdash;viz. the upright figure of the nearest sportsman. Should this happen to be a "new chum"
  enjoying his maiden essay in "gooana" hunting, he will undoubtedly experience a new sensation as
  the animal, with its sharp cat-like claws, unceremoniously scrambles up to his head and
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>Brought to bay, a monitor possesses a more formidable weapon than its teeth and claws wherewith
  to repulse the onslaught of the enemy. The long, tough, thong-like tail&mdash;not brittle and
  replaceable, as in many other lizards&mdash;is converted, for the time being, into a veritable
  stock-whip, wherewith it will most severely punish incautious aggressors who venture too near. The
  potency of this offensive and defensive weapon is fully recognised by the reptile-keepers at the
  Zoo, who freely admit their reluctance to enter the cage of one of these large, long-tailed, but
  conversely very short-tempered monitors. All of the monitors, in consonance with their
  pre-eminently carnivorous habits, are more or less savage and intractable. The several species
  which have fallen within the writer's cognisance proved no exception to the rule. An Egyptian
  example, injudiciously introduced to the select society of his extensive miscellaneous collection
  in a heated greenhouse, proved to be a veritable wolf in the fold, killing several of the choicest
  specimens before its vindictive propensities were detected and arrested. A comparatively small and
  rare spiny-tailed monitor, brought by the writer, in company with the frilled lizards, to England
  from North-west Australia, would harass and bite any other lizard placed with it, and resent every
  friendly overture on the part of its owner, even after so much as a whole twelvemonth's persistent
  attempts to tame it. Another, the South Australian monitor, or lace-lizard, was no exception to
  the rule, and had to be maintained in solitary confinement. This particular specimen,
  nevertheless, evinced, as the following anecdote will show, a very pronounced affection for its
  provided quarters. One day it effected its escape from the wire-enclosed cage with which it was
  accommodated in the writer's Brisbane garden, and after prolonged but unsuccessful searchings it
  was given up for lost. Considerable astonishment was naturally experienced some ten days later,
  when the animal was discovered in the garden making frantic attempts to regain access to its
  former prison-house. During its ten days' absence it had evidently fallen upon evil times, for not
  only was it in a very emaciated condition, but also bereft of its long and handsome tail.
  Apparently, after the manner of its tribe, it had been manifesting a too warm <span
  class="pagenum" id="page574"><span class="smaller">{574}</span></span>interest in some neighbour's
  hen-roost, and received across its tail a stroke with a spade or other cutting instrument that was
  intended for a more vital region. Disgusted by such unfriendly treatment, it evidently determined
  that free board and lodging at the hands of its former owner, albeit with the sacrifice of
  freedom, was a pleasanter line of life than liberty and a precarious commissariat, with added
  bodily risks. An almost identical episode of the voluntary return to captivity of an escaped
  monitor has been reported to the writer of a species from Borneo by Dr. G. D. Haviland.</p>

  <p>The monitors, as a rule, are not distinguished for brilliancy of colouring, shades and
  mottlings of brown or black being usually dominant. The male of the Australian lace-lizard, after
  newly changing its coat, is, however, an exception. In addition to the highly ornate lace-like
  reticulated pattern of its skin-markings, previously referred to, the throat of the animal is
  resplendent with mingled tints of sky-blue and lemon-yellow. It is necessary, however, to observe
  that its natural surroundings and the ardent rays of a sub-tropical sun are requisite to bring
  these brighter tints to their full development. Examples kept in close confinement in the London
  Zoological Gardens yield little or no indication of their colour potentialities.</p>

  <p>While the Monitor Family is not represented on the American Continent, we find there another
  group of lizards whose members are of considerable size, and agree in their carnivorous
  propensities and general habits in a marked manner with the Monitors. These are the <span
  class="sc">"Greaved" Lizards</span>, named with reference to the peculiar skin-folding on their
  legs. One of the largest and most familiarly known representatives of this group is the <span
  class="sc">Teguexin</span>, or <span class="sc">Diamond-lizard</span>, indigenous to the greater
  portion of tropical South America, and also to the West Indies. This lizard attains to a total
  length of a yard or more, and is of a robust and thick-set build, with the hind limbs much longer
  and stouter than the front ones. The colour of the teguexin is also notable, the ground-tint being
  olive or tawny yellow, upon which are superimposed black bands and markings which for the most
  part take a transverse direction. Like the Monitors, the teguexin in captivity exhibits a sulky
  and aggressive disposition, <span class="pagenum" id="page575"><span
  class="smaller">{575}</span></span>and cannot be safely kept in company with other less powerful
  species.</p>

  <p>The attribute of bipedal locomotion is possessed by the teguexin. That this singular method of
  progression was an accomplishment possessed by one of the larger tropical American lizards was
  first reported to the writer from Trinidad. Some species of iguana was, in the first instance,
  anticipated to be the acrobatic performer. Several examples of this family group were accordingly
  put through their paces at the Zoo, to ascertain if they could lay claim to the distinction. None
  of the iguanas available, however, rose (on their hind legs) to the occasion, and it was only on
  experimenting, as a <i>derni&egrave;re ressource</i>, with the teguexin that a successful demonstration
  was accomplished. This lizard was found, in fact, to run bipedally more freely and persistently,
  when sufficient space was allotted it, than the Agamas. It seems singular that this bipedal power
  of locomotion should have so long remained undiscovered, and yet is possessed by lizards which
  have for a number of years been the denizens of many zoological gardens and other menageries. The
  fact that a comparatively large level area is a <i>sine qua non</i> for the exhibition of this
  phenomenon affords no doubt the explanation of this anomaly; but the anomaly itself at the same
  time serves to accentuate the desirability, in the interests of both science and the animals'
  comfort, that exists for providing them in captivity with a more liberal and reasonably sufficient
  space for their indulgence in those methods of locomotion that are natural to them in their native
  land.</p>

  <p>The Greaved Lizard Family includes somewhat over one hundred species. While the majority agree
  with the teguexin in the possession of well-developed limbs, there are a few <span class="pagenum"
  id="page576"><span class="smaller">{576}</span></span>retrograde forms in which the hinder limbs
  are entirely absent or the front ones reduced to mere stumps. These exceptional instances pave the
  way to the family of the Amphisb&aelig;nas, in which such or a still lower phase of limb development
  represents the normal condition. The Amphisb&aelig;nas are remarkable for their worm-like resemblance,
  and for the circumstances that they live like earth-worms in burrows, that their eyes are
  functionless (being concealed beneath the skin), and that they are without ears. Other details of
  structure indicate a most rudimentary condition of development, and they consequently rank as the
  lowest group in the Lizard series. Another peculiarity of the Amphisb&aelig;nas is that, in place of
  scales, the skin of the body is divided into square segments, which form symmetrical rings like
  those of worms. In addition to this, these retrograde lizards possess the worm-like faculty of
  being able to move backwards and forwards in their burrows with equal facility. It is from this
  peculiar property that their title of Amphisb&aelig;na, signifying "moving both ways," is derived. The
  representatives of this family, including between sixty and seventy species, are widely
  distributed, being found in America, the West Indies, Africa, and also European countries that
  border the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>While the Teguexins present resemblances in one direction with the Amphisb&aelig;nas, or Worm-like
  Lizards, the higher or Monitor-like forms have much in common with the Typical or True Lizards, of
  which two small but well-known species&mdash;the <span class="sc">Sand-</span> and <span
  class="sc">Viviparous Lizards</span>&mdash;are indigenous to the British Isles. All the members of
  the True Lizards, numbering some hundred species, are inhabitants of the Old World, becoming
  scarce, however, towards the far east of the Asiatic Continent. All possess shapely bodies and
  well-developed limbs with five-toed feet, and are remarkable for the extreme activity of their
  movements, and in many cases brilliant colouring.</p>

  <p>The varying individual shades of the <span class="sc">Green Lizard</span>'s brilliant emerald
  body are almost infinite, no two being quite precisely alike in this respect. In some a yellower,
  in others a bluer green predominates, while the females and young are more or less mottled or
  striped with brown. The under surface of the body is usually a more or less bright yellow, and the
  throat, in the males more particularly, at the breeding-season is frequently brilliant blue. The
  more conspicuous colour differences exhibited by this lizard are, however, intimately associated
  with the local habitat of the particular race. Those indigenous to Spain and Portugal, for
  example, are more or less ornamented with ocellated spots along the sides of the head and body,
  while those peculiar to Eastern Europe and Asia Minor are, in the young condition more
  particularly, marked with longitudinal streaks, but their throat is never blue.</p>

  <p>The green lizard is one of the most beautiful of its tribe, and, although not indigenous to
  Great Britain, is common in the Channel Islands. In Jersey, more especially during the summer
  months, it is one of the most familiar of the "common objects of the country," as it darts in and
  out of the hedgerows after flies and other insects, or basks in the bright sunshine on some stone
  wall, with its emerald-green body flattened out in order to absorb the greatest possible amount of
  heat. As the colder autumn days advance this lizard is rarely visible, and it finally retires into
  some rocky cleft or burrow in the hedge-bank, and is no more seen until the return of spring.
  Green lizards, liberated in suitably mild spots in the South of England, have been known to thrive
  for brief periods, but succumb to the cold of an extra-severe winter.</p>

  <p>The largest representatives of the green lizard are those inhabiting Eastern Europe and Asia
  Minor, where in size and colour they almost imperceptibly merge into the <span
  class="sc">Pearly</span> or <span class="sc">Ocellated Lizard</span>. This very handsome species,
  which, in company with examples of the green lizard, is frequently imported by London dealers,
  ranges from 16 inches to close upon 2 feet in length. In form it is stouter and more robust than a
  typical green lizard, the head in the old males more particularly being exceptionally massive.
  Whatever may be lacking in grace of form is, however, fully compensated for by brilliancy of
  colouring, no other lizard, in fact, out-rivalling it in this respect. To the brilliant
  shagreen-patterned emerald-green hues of the Jersey species it has superadded along its sides
  eye-like spots of brilliant turquoise or ultra-marine, with dark brown or black encircling lines.
  In the males the green ground-colour has a more distinctly golden hue, while in the young
  individuals the body is more usually olive-colour, dotted throughout with whitish or pearly-blue,
  black-edged spots. This beautiful lizard is unfortunately somewhat irascible in temper, and will
  not as a rule allow itself to <span class="pagenum" id="page578"><span
  class="smaller">{578}</span></span>be handled as freely as the majority of the members of its
  tribe; when biting, moreover, it has a tendency to fasten itself upon the object seized with
  bulldog-like tenacity, a grip from a powerful-jawed old male being a somewhat unpleasant
  experience. In addition to insects the ocellated lizard will prey upon any other small animals it
  can overpower, including the members of its own species; it is consequently not safe to entrust it
  in the company of other lizards of less size and strength.</p>

  <p>The Skink Family, which next invites attention, contains no less than 400 known species, and,
  climatic conditions being favourable, enjoys an almost cosmopolitan distribution. The majority of
  its members have stoutish cylindrical bodies, with relatively short limbs and tail; the legs are
  sometimes reduced to two only, or altogether aborted, giving the animal a snakelike form.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Common</span> or "<span class="sc">Medicinal</span>" <span
  class="sc">Skink</span>&mdash;so called since it was regarded in the Middle Ages as an infallible
  medicinal nostrum&mdash;is an inhabitant of North Africa, and notable for its adaptation to a
  sand-burrowing existence. The body is short, cylindrical, exceedingly smooth through the close
  apposition of the minute surface-scales, and sharply conical at each extremity. The well-developed
  toes of all four feet are flattened and serrated at their edges in such a manner that they
  constitute most effective burrowing-tools in the loose sand these lizards frequent. The length of
  this skink rarely exceeds 3 or 4 inches. Its colour is rather exceptional for a lizard, but at the
  same time in keeping with its predominating subterranean habits. The ground-tint in the living
  examples in the writer's possession, one of which is photographed on page <a
  href="#page579">579</a>, was a light yellowish-white, like that of old polished ivory, with here
  and there a pale flesh-pink tinge. On the under-surface this light tint was persistent, while the
  back was traversed by some twelve broadish bands of pale slate-grey. The skink does not, like the
  mole and the Amphisb&aelig;nas, obtain its food from subterranean sources. It comes out to bask on the
  surface of the sand when the sun is at its height, and keeps a brisk look-out for flies or other
  insects, which, if they approach sufficiently near, are pounced upon with remarkably agility.
  Should the sky become overcast or any cause for alarm manifest itself, the skink disappears
  beneath the sand as though by magic, not infrequently burrowing down to a depth of several feet.
  Even at the present day the skink is esteemed by the Arabs both for medicine and food, and in the
  latter association, well broiled, has won the commendation of European palates.</p>

  <p>One of the most bizarre members of the Skink Family hails from Australia, where it is known as
  the <span class="sc">Stump-tailed Lizard</span>. The most remarkable feature in this form is the
  shortness and roundness of the caudal appendage, the contour and proportions of which, in fact, so
  nearly correspond with those of the head that it was originally described by its discoverer,
  Captain William Dampier, just over three centuries ago, as a double-headed animal. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page579"><span class="smaller">{579}</span></span>To quote his own quaint
  description: "The land animals we saw here [Sharks' Bay] included a sort of guanos of the same
  shape and size with other guanos, but differing from them in three remarkable particulars, for
  these had a larger and uglier head, and had no tail, and at the rump, instead of a tail there,
  they had a stump of a tail which appeared like another head, but not really, such being without
  mouth or eyes; yet this creature seemed by this means to have a head at each end."</p>

      <p class="sp0">Lives and burrows in the sand, coming out when the sun shines.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A specimen of the stump-tailed lizard is usually on view at the Regent's Park Gardens, and will
  afford visitors an opportunity for its comparison in the flesh with Dampier's description. Fine
  specimens of the stump-tail will measure as much as 10 inches in length, and are thick in
  proportion, the legs, however, being very small and weak. The surface of the back is covered with
  large, overlapping scales, that, in conjunction with its customarily dark brown or blackish hue,
  convey to it a marked resemblance to a long, imbricated fir-cone. On the under-surface the scales
  are in comparison very small; the colouring in this region is also usually light grey or yellow,
  variegated with darker reticulations.</p>

  <p>Stump-tails make most good-natured and grotesque household pets. Of two examples which were for
  some years in the writer's possession a characteristic photograph is reproduced below. When
  basking in the sun, the tail often becomes distended to enormous proportions. The internal
  substance of this abnormally dilated organ consists chiefly of fatty tissue, and it seems probable
  that it fulfils the r&ocirc;le of a reservoir for the storage of nutrient and heating materials, to be
  drawn upon during hibernation. The winter months in the southern districts of Western Australia
  are cold, and this lizard, in common with other local species, retires during that season into the
  sheltering recess of a hollow tree-stump or rock-crevice until the sun is again in the ascendant.
  The stump-tail is practically omnivorous in its habits. In captivity fruit, and more especially
  bananas, constitute a favourite diet, but it will also greedily devour worms, beetles, and
  garden-snails, and may consequently be turned to good account as a destroyer of garden-pests.</p>

  <p>Of other Australian members of the Skink Family, the <span class="sc">Great Cyclodus</span>, or
  <span class="sc">Blue-tongued Lizard</span>, may be mentioned. This species, which is about 18
  inches long, presents no abnormal development of head or tail, as in the form last described. The
  body is smooth and sub-cylindrical, and with its closely set scales resembles that of a snake. The
  dominant colour is a soft steel or silvery grey, variegated with darker or lighter cross-bands and
  reticulations that are most strongly marked on the sides; the under-surface, by way of contrast,
  is most usually pale <span class="pagenum" id="page580"><span
  class="smaller">{580}</span></span>salmon-pink. The tongue of this lizard, which gives to it its
  popular title, is somewhat remarkable. It is large and flat, and of a bright blue tint, resembling
  nothing so much as a piece of blue flannel. The animal, as it moves about, is in the habit of
  constantly protruding and retracting its tongue, which consequently constitutes a very conspicuous
  object. In common with the majority of its allies, the blue-tongued lizard is viviparous; but
  while the stump-tail only produces one at a time, which is nearly half as large as the parent, the
  present form gives birth to as many as ten or twelve. An example in the writer's possession on one
  occasion presented him with a litter embracing the larger number, and afforded the material for
  the photograph here reproduced.</p>

  <p>As a contrast to the two preceding forms, the <span class="sc">Spine-tailed Lizards</span>,
  with their short, flat, spiky tails, may be cited as a conclusion to this notice of the Skink
  Family. There are nine known members of the same genus, all inhabitants of Australia. The lower of
  the two forms here figured is especially abundant on one island of the Abrolhos group, off the
  Western Australian coast. This example is represented at about two-thirds of its natural size. It
  is an interesting fact that an allied but considerably larger species monopolises a neighbouring
  island of the same group, the two species not intermingling: probably the larger one would prey on
  the smaller. The largest member of the genus, known as <span class="sc">Cunningham's
  Spine-tail</span>, of a uniform black hue, peppered white, is not infrequently brought to Europe,
  and two examples which were for some years in the writer's possession bred regularly, producing
  eight or ten young at a time for several consecutive years. The fact that these lizards enjoyed
  full liberty in a heated greenhouse, with a temperature and surrounding conditions closely
  identical with those to which they were naturally accustomed, no doubt contributed extensively to
  their fertility.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Cham&aelig;leons</span> differ in so many important structural points from the
  ordinary lizards that they are usually regarded now by scientists as a distinct reptilian
  sub-order. The essential characters, externally recognisable, that serve to distinguish the
  cham&aelig;leons are:&mdash;Firstly, the extraordinary development of their worm-like extensile tongue,
  the tip of it club-shaped and highly viscous, and the shaft cylindrical and as elastic in texture
  as india-rubber. Adapted for the special object of catching flies, this organ can be projected
  from the mouth to a distance of 6 or 8 inches or more with lightning-like rapidity, and rarely
  misses its quarry. Comparing small things with great, the cham&aelig;leon's tongue and its action might
  be likened to a schoolboy's popgun, having its pellet secured to the barrel by a long elastic
  ligament. Presuming further that the pellet is covered with a viscid secretion such as bird-lime,
  and that the object shot at is hit and brought back to the shooter's pocket by virtue of the
  ligament's intrinsic elasticity, we have an almost veritable replica of the cham&aelig;leon's
  fly-catching apparatus. The second remarkable structural peculiarity of the cham&aelig;leon is the
  independent relationship of the two eyes. The eyes themselves are unlike those of any other
  lizards; they are large, prominent, skin-covered cones, perforated only at their extreme apex for
  the minute pupil-opening: while one eye may be fixed on an object in front of it, the other may be
  rolling around in search of a second quarry. This independent capacity of vision, while peculiar
  among reptiles to the cham&aelig;leon, is common to many fishes, such as blennies and flat-fishes. A
  third anomaly in the cham&aelig;leon's structure is the character of the feet; these resemble those of a
  parrot, the toes being bound together in two opposable bundles. In the fore foot the inner bundle
  contains three and the outer one two toes only, while in the hind foot the order <span
  class="pagenum" id="page582"><span class="smaller">{582}</span></span>of their amalgamation is
  precisely reversed. In either case these feet subserve, as in parrots and other perching-birds, as
  most effective organs for maintaining a close grip upon the tree-branches among which they
  habitually live. The tail of the cham&aelig;leon is, finally, highly prehensile, and, as with the New
  World monkeys, constitutes a veritable fifth hand, wherewith to ensure it against falling off its
  perch.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The colour-changing properties of the cham&aelig;leon have been the subject of enthusiastic but in
  many instances exaggerated descriptions from the earliest times. As a matter of fact there are
  other lizard species which share this kaleidoscopic property to an equal or even greater degree.
  The Indian tree-geckos, referred to on a previous page, as also the calotes from the same region,
  are cases in point. Cham&aelig;leons are undoubtedly possessed of marvellous colour-changing faculties,
  and it would appear to be scarcely in all instances, as is more usually represented, a case of
  adapting themselves to the tints of their environment. The assumption of leaf-green, grey, brown,
  reddish, or yellowish tints, in accordance with their surroundings, is the ordinary record. Some
  examples which formed the subjects of the writer's experiments exhibited, however, interesting
  deviations from the beaten track. Male individuals, in particular, were observed to assume tints
  and decorative patterns that rendered them remarkably conspicuous objects, in spite of their leafy
  environment. The normal ground-colour of these specimens in full daylight was so dark a green that
  it might be almost characterised as black. Upon this were superimposed lines and spottings of
  strongly contrasting tints. The more dominant of these was a brilliant orange, that was
  distributed in bold lines along the head and cheeks, and formed a radiating pattern on the
  skin-covered eye-cones: The same colour formed somewhat broken-up bars across all four limbs, and
  was dispersed in bold spots over the entire remaining body-surface: along the tail these spots
  were concentrated in threes, giving it a semi-barred appearance. All among these orange limb- and
  body-spottings were distributed a secondary series of somewhat smaller spots, the tint of which
  was a pale but very brilliant emerald-green. This cham&aelig;leon asleep at night was a very different
  animal. The ground-colour was transformed from almost black to a bright grass-green. The orange
  lines became lighter in colour and broken up into patches; many of the orange spots on the body
  disappeared, but those remaining were of larger size and concentrated in threes in two lines along
  each side, these triple spots enclosing centrally a larger elongated spot or patch of bright pink
  or puce. The bright emerald-green secondary spots, as seen in daylight, were almost white. If
  handled during the daytime, the cham&aelig;leon was wont to assume a colour nearly identical with his
  night garb; the two lines of pink patches, previously invisible, would appear, and, while the
  orange spotting remained constant, the emerald-green changed to lemon-yellow.</p>

  <p>A cham&aelig;leon in a rage is a decidedly grotesque object. The back is arched, the body and more
  especially the throat-pouch are inflated to their fullest extent, the mouth is opened, the eyes
  roll, and the creature rocks itself to and fro and hisses in a most threatening manner. When, as
  often happens, it also simultaneously sits up on its haunches, the effect is doubtless as
  terrifying as it is intended to be to a rival cham&aelig;leon or any small animal which may venture to
  approach it. A number of other lizards, including tree-climbing varieties, were introduced to the
  company of the examples under observation, and until friendly acquaintanceship had been
  established their advances towards the cham&aelig;leons were always repelled.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The majority of the cham&aelig;leons lay eggs, but a small number produce living young,
  as with skinks and other lizards. Examples of the common European and North African species kept
  by the writer excavated holes in the earth, in which they laid their eggs, and then carefully
  covered them up again. Unfortunately these eggs were not fertilised. One South African species has
  been reported to the writer as being in the habit of placing and separately wrapping and fastening
  up each egg as deposited in the leaves of the tree in which it resided. While Africa and
  Madagascar represent the head centres of distribution of the fifty odd known species of
  cham&aelig;leons, they enter Europe through the Spanish Peninsula, and extend eastward to Arabia, India,
  and Ceylon. The largest known variety, which inhabits Madagascar, attains a length of 15 inches;
  the smallest pygmy cham&aelig;leon of the Cape scarcely measures 2&frac12; inches.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">The Tuatera.</span></p>

  <p>That singular reptile found on certain small islands lying to the north-east of New Zealand,
  and known as the <span class="sc">Tuatera</span>, differs in so many structural characters from
  all other lizards that it is assigned to a separate order. Externally the tuatera does not differ
  materially in form from an ordinary lizard. The skin, however, is peculiar for its leathery,
  granulated, and wrinkled texture; there is no trace of external ears; the eyes, adapted for
  nocturnal vision, have in daylight vertical pupils; and the bases of the toes are united by
  connecting webs. The deeper internal characteristics include the possession of supplementary
  so-called abdominal ribs, the presence of which are readily apprehended on handling the living
  animal. These structures, while absent in ordinary lizards, find their near equivalent in the
  breastplate of tortoises and turtles. The teeth are not implanted in distinct sockets, but
  attached to the summits of the jaws, which are developed in a beak-like manner, and in older
  individuals fulfil, after the manner of a beak, the functions of the worn-out incisor teeth.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>SNAKES.</i></p>

  <p>The characteristic contour of a snake's body is too familiar to need elaborate description; its
  leading features are, in fact, so nearly approximated by certain of the legless lizards,
  previously described, that the distinctions between the two can with difficulty be defined. Many
  of the snake-like lizards, including the Common Blind-worm, are altogether devoid of external
  limbs. In some snakes, on the other hand, and notably the large terrestrial Pythons, a spur-like
  development on each side of the base of the tail represents rudimentary hind legs. The Snakes
  agree essentially with the Lizards in the character of their scaly covering, the scales, however,
  being larger on their under-surface and specially adapted, as in the legless lizards, for creeping
  locomotion. The essential distinctions between the two groups have to be sought in the structure
  of the head. The most notable of these, as it obtains in the Snakes, is the very loose manner in
  which all the bones connected with the jaws are held together, thus providing for the greatest
  possible distension in the act of their swallowing their prey whole, as is the custom of all
  ordinary snakes. To achieve this end, the two halves of the lower jaw are not united together at
  their extremity or chin, as in lizards, but are merely connected with one another by an elastic
  ligament. In most snakes the bones of the upper jaw and palate are also attached to one another in
  a similar way.</p>

  <p>The eyes of a snake differ in a very marked manner from those of ordinary lizards. No snake
  possesses movable eyelids. The eye, in compensation, is protected by a transparent horny disk,
  continuous with the general epidermis, and is shed with it when the snake casts its skin. This
  feature imparts to snakes that fixed, stony expression of the eyes which undoubtedly contributes
  very materially towards increasing the feeling of repulsion with which snakes are commonly
  regarded. A few exceptional lizards, such as the Geckos, have a similar eye-construction, but it
  is not met with in any of the limbless or snake-like forms. No snakes, again, show any trace of
  external ear-openings, such structures, on the other hand, being distinctly developed in almost
  all lizards. The head itself of the snake is never compressed or elevated, as in most lizards, but
  flattened down and usually wider than the body, to which, however, it is united without a distinct
  neck. The tongue of the snake is slender, and terminates in two long, thread-like points; basally
  it is inserted into a hollow sheath, into or out of which the entire organ can be retracted or
  exserted at will. The somewhat uncanny, flickering action with which a snake, while moving,
  displays and as it were feels its way with its long, forked tongue represents another element
  which adds to the <span class="pagenum" id="page586"><span
  class="smaller">{586}</span></span>disfavour with which these reptiles are commonly regarded.
  Among the uneducated even at the present day it is not unusual to hear the tongue, with reference
  to its peculiar shape and vibrating action, pronounced to be the seat and instrument of the
  animal's poisonous properties. The swift, silent, stealthy, gliding motions with which, apart from
  any visible organs of locomotion, a snake slides, as it were, along the ground and over all
  obstacles fill to the brink the measure for its condemnation in the estimation of all but the
  snake-devotee or the naturalist.</p>

  <p>The locomotion of the snake is, as a matter of fact, one of the most remarkable and beautifully
  contrived phenomena in animal mechanics. The peculiarly jointed and abnormally mobile ribs
  constitute the mystic <i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i> by which the reptile accomplishes its migration.
  These ribs articulate in pairs by a single mobile head with their respective segment of the
  vertebral column. At their opposite extremity they impinge on and are in muscular connection with
  the broad, slightly overlapping, shield-like scales which clothe the under surface of the body.
  The rib-muscles, contracting in rhythmical succession, raise the free overlapping edges of the
  shield-like scales, which, striking against the ground in the same regular order, push the body
  forward. Adopting an easily comprehensible simile, the snake's body is carried along the ground on
  the same principle as a paddle-wheel steamer is pushed along the surface of the water, the
  paddle-boards in the case of the snake being affixed to a long, narrow plane instead of a circular
  wheel.</p>

  <p>The poison-fangs of snakes are highly specialised structures, and their presence or otherwise
  was formerly considered sufficiently distinctive for the separation of these reptiles into two
  sharply defined natural series. More recent investigations have, however, shown that such a system
  of classification is entirely artificial, both venomous and harmless species occurring among
  groups which are related to one another by essential structural characters. The teeth in the
  ordinary or harmless snakes are usually represented by two rows of slender, recurved, sharply
  pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a single row of a similar character in the lower one. This
  recurved character of the dentition effectively assists the snake in gorging its quarry whole,
  nothing once seized by the hook-like teeth having a chance of retreating, the snake itself being
  unable to eject the prey upon which the teeth have fastened. In the most poisonous series, such as
  a rattle-snake, there is but a single row of recurved teeth in the upper jaw, and these are the
  equivalents of the inner set of the harmless species. Among the most venomous snakes the
  poison-fangs are tubular in character, the poison being received from the venom-glands at their
  open base, and discharged at the apex. In other forms the fangs have grooved channels only for the
  passage of the virus, while in other species there may be an intermediate condition. In all cases
  the poison-secreting glands are modifications of the ordinary salivary glands of other vertebrate
  animals. They are situated, one on each side, immediately below and behind the eyes, and are in
  some instances so abnormally developed as to extend backwards along the sides of the body. Special
  muscles envelop these glands, and force the poison into the hollow base of the fangs when the
  mouth is opened to strike.</p>

  <p>Snakes, like lizards, are most abundant in tropical countries, the Indian and Malay regions in
  particular being richest in numbers and varieties. The British Islands support but three
  representatives of the class&mdash;the <span class="sc">Adder</span>, the <span class="sc">Common
  Ringed</span> and the <span class="sc">Smooth Snakes</span>&mdash;this number, by a coincidence,
  being identical with that of the Lizard Tribe indigenous to the same islands. Many of the smaller
  species are little over 1 foot long, while the huge Pythons and the Anaconda may attain to or
  exceed 30 feet. Regarding their habits, some are purely terrestrial, frequenting the rocks or
  sandy deserts, or even burrowing beneath the earth's surface. Others are essentially arboreal,
  many amphibious, and some, like the Turtles among the Chelonians, entirely marine. As with the
  Lizards, the majority of snakes lay eggs enclosed within a white leathery shell, while with a
  considerable number the young are brought forth alive. The eggs, deposited in the earth, sand, or
  among vegetable debris, are usually left to be hatched by the heat of the sun. In the case of the
  Pythons, however, they are incubated by the parent.</p>

  <p>A small group of snakes which is usually placed at the head of the series in systematic
  classifications share the subterranean habits of the Amphisb&aelig;nas among the Lizards; and the eyes
  being rudimentary and functionless, they are commonly known as <span
  class="sc">Blind-snakes</span>. A structural peculiarity which separates these singular reptiles
  from all other members of the Snake Tribe is the entire absence of teeth from either the upper or
  lower jaw. The food of the blind-snakes consists largely of ants and the larv&aelig; of beetles and
  other insects which lead a subterranean life. Although spending the greater portion of their
  existence underground, they occasionally come out upon the surface, such migrations more generally
  taking place during showery weather. About 100 species of blind-snakes are known, and are mostly
  confined to tropical countries. One small worm-like form occurs in Greece and the adjacent
  islands, its range extending through a considerable area of South-western Asia.</p>

  <p>The step from the small worm-like Blind-snakes, with their functionless eyes and underground
  habits, to the Boas and Pythons, the largest and most highly organised members of the Serpent
  Tribe, would seem at first sight to be altogether unwarranted. In one essential character,
  however, they agree very remarkably. In both groups the bony skeleton exhibits a far more
  generalised structural plan than in any of the succeeding ones, so that they may be regarded as
  more nearly resembling the primitive stock from which the other more specialised kinds&mdash;such
  as the Vipers, with their death-dealing poison-fangs&mdash;have been evolved.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Pythons</span> and <span class="sc">Boas</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Boa-constrictors</span>, as they are popularly known, belong entirely to the
  non-venomous section of the Snake series. The teeth, forming two rows in the upper jaws, gradually
  decrease in size from before backwards, and none of them are grooved or modified in the form of
  poison-fangs. The body is usually more or less compressed, and the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page589"><span class="smaller">{589}</span></span>tail prehensile. The <span
  class="sc">Typical Pythons</span>, or <span class="sc">Rock-snakes</span>, as they are called,
  with reference to their rock-frequenting habits, are distributed throughout South-eastern Asia,
  Australia, and Central and South Africa.</p>

      skin-ornamentation.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Indian Python</span>, which is the largest Old World representative of its
  race, is known authentically to attain to a length of 30 feet, and in the largest specimens the
  spinal column may include over 400 vertebr&aelig;. In common with other members of its family, this huge
  snake kills its quarry by compression or strangulation, throwing around it successive coils of its
  body, which, with their contraction, crush out the life of the victim. The dispatched prey is then
  swallowed whole, commencing with the head. The previous crushing of the bony framework greatly
  assists the swallowing process, which is further aided by the snake pouring over the body of its
  victim a copious discharge of saliva.</p>

  <p>The extent to which the jaws and the integument of the body generally can be distended for the
  passage and reception of the food is remarkable. After partaking of a solid meal in this fashion,
  pythons remain sluggish and in a state of semi-torpor for several days, not reawakening to active
  life, in fact, until the digestion of the food has been accomplished. As is well known, these and
  other snakes can exist for periods of many months' duration between their meals. One of the
  largest Indian pythons by no means contents itself with such small quarry as hares and
  rabbits&mdash;sheep, young calves, and some of the smaller deer representing its more accustomed
  food. The human species unarmed is as weak or weaker than the proverbial kitten, pitted against
  the hydraulic-press-like embrace of these monster serpents; and many an Indian native, and more
  rarely the white man, has fallen a victim to their attacks.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Reticulated Python</span>, so called on account of the bold reticulated
  pattern of the skin-ornamentation, may equal, if not exceed, the Indian species in dimensions. It
  is a native of Burma, Siam, and the Malay region generally, and is recorded as occasionally
  exceeding 30 feet in length. Examples of this species, including one over 20 feet long, have
  constituted leading attractions at the Reptile-house in the Zoological Society's Gardens for many
  years past. The gorgeous prismatic tints that play upon the surface-markings of the coils of these
  huge snakes, as the sun strikes upon them about midday in their cages, form one of the most
  wonderful sights that the Gardens afford.</p>

  <p>The African Continent also produces its large species of pythons. One of these, attaining to a
  length of 20 feet or more, reaches its maximum on the west coast, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page590"><span class="smaller">{590}</span></span>and occurs with local modifications as far

  <p>Some rather singular incidents have been recorded illustrating the tenacity with which pythons
  retain hold of the quarry once seized, or, more correctly, their inability to release it. At the
  Adelaide Zoological Gardens a specimen, when absorbing a rabbit, managed to entangle its teeth in
  a corner of its blanket. That blanket had to follow the rodent through the 12-foot-long python. On
  another occasion two pythons, a Queenslander and Afrikander, happened at the same instant to
  commandeer respectively the head and hindquarters of an identical rabbit. Inch by inch the portion
  between the two grew smaller until the two noses met. There was no retreating from this
  <i>impasse</i>, and the momentous question, "Shall I slay my brother boa?" had to be settled
  affirmatively by one or other of the interested parties without further parley. The somewhat
  smaller and weaker individual was gradually telescoped, and in due time assimilated. The absorber
  was decidedly poorly and "off colour" for a considerable period after accomplishing this
  cannibalistic feat; it ultimately recovered both its appetite and its prismatic tints.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">True Boas</span>, as distinguished from the Pythons, are more essentially
  arboreal in their habits, and, with the exception of one or two species found in Madagascar,
  belong to the tropical American zoological region. The <span class="sc">Common Boa</span>, or
  <span class="sc">Boa-constrictor</span>, which attains to a length of 12 or 14 feet or more, is
  limited in its distribution to South America. The colours of this snake, which consist mainly of a
  light brown, with a number of dark brown cross-bars on the back, and light centred, dark brown
  spots on the sides, so nearly agree with the tint of the tree-branches with their interlacing
  shadows, among which it usually lies concealed, that, notwithstanding its large size, it readily
  evades detection, and is unconsciously approached by the animals on which it preys. These, in
  adult individuals, may be represented by such large-sized quarry as dogs, and even deer; while
  smaller examples prey largely on birds and their eggs, and the numerous rodents with which the
  tropical American forests teem. From observations made upon this species in captivity, it would
  appear that the eggs are usually hatched within the parent's body, though an instance has been
  recorded in which both eggs and young were produced simultaneously.</p>

  <p>A close ally of the typical boas, which shares with them a tropical South American <span
  class="pagenum" id="page591"><span class="smaller">{591}</span></span>habitat, is the huge <span
  class="sc">Anaconda</span>, or <span class="sc">Water-boa</span>, of Brazil and the adjacent
  countries. This animal, which is undoubtedly the largest living representative of the Serpent
  Tribe, attains a length little, if any, short of 40 feet. One such monster was specially referred
  to by Dr. Gardiner, the botanist, in his "Travels in Brazil"; it had devoured a horse, and was
  found dead, entangled in the branches of a tree overhanging a river, into which it had been
  carried by a flood. Full-grown cattle, and occasionally human beings, as well as horses, are
  alleged to fall victims to the destructive prowess of this gigantic snake. The anaconda is
  essentially amphibious in its habits, the greater part of its life being spent in the water, lying
  in wait, in the quiet lagoons and backwaters, with only its head above the surface, and prepared
  to seize any unfortunate animal which may come to the brink to drink. At other times it will coil
  itself upon the trunks and larger branches of the adjacent trees, and from that point of vantage
  will dart down its head, with sure aim and lightning rapidity, to seize any suitable quarry which
  may pass beneath. In some parts of South America where the rivers dry up at certain seasons of the
  year, the anaconda is recorded to be in the habit of burying itself in the mud and lying torpid,
  after the manner of crocodiles, until the return of the rains. The ground-colour of the anaconda
  is usually greyish brown or olive above, the back being ornamented with one or two transversely
  disposed rows of large, rounded, dark brown or blackish spots, while the sides are decorated with
  more irregularly scattered, smaller, eye-like spots, having whitish centres and dark margins.</p>

  <p>An interesting little group, connecting the Boas and Pythons with the Common Snakes, is that of
  the so-called <span class="sc">Shield-tails</span>, or <span class="sc">Earth-snakes</span>, of
  India and Ceylon. These reptiles are earth-burrowers, like the Blind-snakes, previously referred
  to, but have well-developed eyes, and are further distinguished by the abruptly truncated contour
  of their posterior extremity, which may be either a naked disk or covered with keeled scales.
  Their bodies are cylindrical, with the scaly covering very smooth and polished, the scales of the
  under-surface being but little larger than the upper ones; the jaws, in conformity with the
  peculiar modification of their skull, are not capable of wide distension. Seven genera and a large
  number of species are recognised, some being brilliantly coloured with tints of red or yellow.
  Their main diet is earth-worms.</p>

  <p>The family of the <span class="sc">Common Snakes</span> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page592"><span class="smaller">{592}</span></span>includes the greater number of species, the
  majority of the most venomous as well as harmless varieties being comprised within its limits. The
  characters that are made the basis for separating these snakes from the Boas are associated with
  the structure of the skull, and are not therefore readily recognised without having recourse to
  dissection. It will suffice to mention that, in this and the remaining groups, there is an entire
  absence from the lower jaw of the slender supplementary bone known as the "coronoid," which is
  present in the Boas and Pythons. From succeeding groups, such as the Viperine series, they are
  distinguished by the circumstance that the upper jaw is firmly fixed in a horizontal position, and
  is not capable of erection in a vertical plane, or like the lid of a box, as obtains with the
  Vipers.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These snakes are separated into secondary groups with relation to the structure of their teeth.
  In one series these teeth are solid throughout, neither grooved nor tubular; and all the snakes
  thus characterised are harmless. In the second series one or more pairs of the hinder upper teeth
  are longitudinally grooved, and act as poison-fangs; they are consequently distinguished as the
  "back-fanged" group. In the third series the front teeth of the upper jaw-bone are grooved, and
  constitute the poison-fangs, and they are known as the "front-fanged" group.</p>

  <p>To the first-mentioned solid-toothed and harmless division of the family belongs the <span
  class="sc">British Ringed Snake</span> and some forty other allied species which are collectively
  known as <span class="sc">Water-snakes</span>, with reference to their more or less pronounced
  aquatic habits. The ringed snake has a stoutish cylindrical body, keeled scales, flat head covered
  with regular shields, wide mouth-cleft, and numerous teeth, the strongest of which are at the
  hinder end of the jaw-bone. The colour varies somewhat, being usually grey, brown, or olive above,
  with darker spots or narrow transverse bands; the under-surface is mottled black and white or
  grey. The lip-shields are white or yellowish, with black dividing-lines. The neck in the ordinary
  variety is usually ornamented with a yellow, white, or orange collar-like patch, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page593"><span class="smaller">{593}</span></span>behind which is a somewhat
  broader black collar, which is produced forwards and sub-divides the yellow one in the centre of
  the upper-surface. In the variety of the ringed snake indigenous to the South of Europe the
  collar-like markings may be altogether absent, or reduced to a small black patch on each side of
  the nape of the neck. The maximum length of the ringed snake is some 6&frac12; feet. It is a most expert
  swimmer, moving swiftly through the water with lateral undulations of its body, and carrying its
  head and neck well above the surface. Frogs constitute its favourite diet, but it will also
  capture and devour fish, mice, and young birds.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Viperine</span> and <span class="sc">Tesselated Snakes</span>, both
  European forms, as also the <span class="sc">Garter-</span> and <span
  class="sc">Mocassin-snakes</span> of North America, are all closely allied in structure and habits
  to the familiar ringed species. The second British species, known as the <span class="sc">Smooth
  Snake</span>, belongs to the same group, but is more terrestrial in its habits; while
  comparatively rare in England, and limited to the southern counties, it is plentiful on the
  Continent. The <span class="sc">Indian Rat-snake</span>, which is almost as useful as the domestic
  cat in ridding dwellings of rats and mice, is another representative of the solid-toothed group.
  This group also includes the so-called <span class="sc">Pygmy Snakes</span>, inhabiting the Malay
  region, whose habits are mainly arboreal. They are the most diminutive members of their order,
  some of the thirty known species not exceeding 1 foot in length.</p>

  <p>The typical <span class="sc">Tree-snakes</span> of the Indian and Australian region, with large
  eyes, somewhat compressed bodies, and colours of green or olive, in harmonious accord with their
  arboreal surroundings, also belong to the solid-toothed and harmless section. An especially
  interesting representative of this group is the so-called <span class="sc">Egg-eating Snake</span>
  of South Africa. It does not exceed 2 feet in length, and is for the most part arboreal in its
  habits, and, as its name implies, would appear to feed exclusively on eggs. As a structural
  adaptation for this peculiar habit, the spinous processes of a number of the vertebr&aelig; project into
  the throat <span class="pagenum" id="page594"><span class="smaller">{594}</span></span>and are
  tipped with enamel, thus constituting supplementary throat-teeth. Normally this snake subsists on
  the eggs of the smaller birds, but when short of this supply has been known to leave the trees and
  rob hen-roosts, being able, notwithstanding its comparatively small size, to dilate its mouth and
  throat for the reception of a hen's egg. The egg is split longitudinally by the action of the
  throat-teeth, the contents swallowed, and the shell ejected.</p>

  <p>The second or "back-fanged" group includes many exceedingly poisonous species. Among these may
  be mentioned the <span class="sc">Indian Whip-snakes</span> and their allies, comprising many
  tree-frequenting species, closely resembling in habits and colours the harmless solid-toothed
  tree-snakes of the preceding section.</p>

  <p>It is among the third or "front-fanged" group, however, that the most venomous species occur.
  To this section belongs the death-dealing <span class="sc">Cobra</span>, the yet more formidable
  <span class="sc">Hamadryad</span>, the <span class="sc">Indian Craits</span>, the <span
  class="sc">Egyptian Asp</span>, and the <span class="sc">Australian Black Snakes</span> and <span
  class="sc">Death-adders</span>. The <span class="sc">Cobra-de-capello</span>, <span
  class="sc">Hooded</span>, or <span class="sc">Spectacled Snake</span>, as it is variously known,
  is perhaps the most notoriously familiar example of its section, being responsible for the greater
  moiety of the many thousands of fatalities that annually occur among the natives of India from the
  bites of venomous serpents. The craits, which resemble the cobras, but do not possess an erectile
  hood, are accredited a second position in death-dealing. The peculiar feature of the erectile hood
  that characterises the cobras is due to the circumstance that a certain number of the ribs in this
  region are independently movable, and can be elevated and depressed at will, the skin-fold that
  overlies them being loose and elastic. The back of the hood in the ordinary Indian cobra is
  usually ornamented with two eye-like spots, connected with a loop-like band, which communicate to
  the complete pattern the fancied resemblance to a pair of spectacles, whence it has derived its
  appellation of Spectacled Snake. Individuals vary, however, very considerably in this matter of
  colour-markings; in some instances a single eye-like spot is alone developed, while in others it
  may be entirely absent. The <span class="sc">Common Cobra</span> grows to a length of 6 or 7 feet,
  dimensions greatly exceeded by the <span class="sc">Giant Cobra</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Hamadryad</span>, a fortunately rarer form more exclusively confined to jungle and
  forest districts. This species may attain to a length of 13 feet or more, and on account of its
  deadly bite and fiercely aggressive disposition is much feared by the natives of the countries it
  inhabits, which include not only India, but Burma, Siam, and the Malay region. This giant cobra
  preys almost exclusively on smaller snakes, frequently including the common cobra.</p>

  <p>A third species of cobra, known as the <span class="sc">Haj&eacute;</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Spitting-snake</span>, inhabits Africa, from Egypt as far south as Natal. It is perhaps
  the fiercest member of the group, turning readily upon its pursuers, or even commencing the
  attack. It also possesses the somewhat remarkable and disconcerting habit of ejecting poison from
  its mouth to a distance of several feet, usually aiming with considerable accuracy at the eyes of
  its assailant. Although unattended by permanently serious effects, the pain caused by the virus
  striking the eyes is for the time being excruciatingly painful, placing the recipient of the
  unwelcome discharge entirely <i>hors de combat</i>. The first record of the poison-spitting
  propensities of this snake, made by Mr. Gordon Cumming, was received with considerable
  incredulity, but the statement has been confirmed. A relative of the writer's, stationed in Natal,
  was recently the victim of such an incident, receiving the poison-discharge in his eyes from one
  of these snakes, which, in his eagerness to dispatch it, he had imprudently cornered, armed only
  with a sword. It was some days before the pain entirely abated and the sight regained its normal
  clearness.</p>

  <p>Australia, with its <span class="sc">Black</span> and <span class="sc">Tiger-snakes</span> and
  the <span class="sc">Death-adder</span>, possesses snakes as venomous as the cobra, which the
  first-named species approach in their capacity to inflate their necks, though to a less degree.
  The <span class="sc">Tasmanian Black Snake</span>, as it glides swiftly, as though sailing, across
  open grass-land, with the midday sun scintillating on its 7-foot stretch of jet-black, highly
  polished scales, its head and expanded neck threateningly elevated some 18 inches above the
  ground, is certainly a most impressive sight.</p>

  <p>One very distinct group of the front-fanged section which demands brief notice is that of the
  <span class="sc">Sea-snakes</span>. These are readily distinguished by their especial adaptation
  to a marine existence, their much-compressed, oar-like tails constituting powerful propelling
  organs. In contradistinction to the terrestrial snakes of the same group, the inferior scales, not
  being required for terrestrial locomotion, are little if any larger than the upper ones. All the
  species are highly venomous; they feed chiefly upon fish, and are distributed throughout the
  tropical seas. The larger species rarely exceed 5 or 6 feet in length, and the majority are much
  smaller. Many species are noted for their conspicuous colouring, which most frequently takes the
  form of distinctly contrasting bands. All the members of this group are viviparous.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The rattle-snake is pre-eminently noted for its power of fascinating birds and
      the smaller mammals.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The last and most highly specialised section of the Snake Tribe is that of the <span
  class="sc">Viper</span> and its allies, collectively known as the Viperine Family. In all the
  representatives of this group the hinder upper jaw-bone is so loosely articulated that it is
  capable of erection at a right angle to the horizontal plane of the skull, the gape of the mouth
  being in consequence abnormally wide. The teeth in the upper jaw are reduced to a single
  anteriorly situated pair of tubular poison-fangs, with which, when striking its prey, the snake
  deals a direct stab. The head in the majority of the Viperine Snakes is flattened and triangular,
  nearly resembling in contour the symbolic ace of spades. The body is usually relatively thick, and
  the tail short and stumpy. The vertical pupil of the eye denotes nocturnal habits. All the members
  of the section are venomous.</p>

  <p>The Viperine Snakes are usually divided into two groups. The first contains the Typical or Old
  World Vipers, and includes, in addition to the <span class="sc">Common Viper</span>, the <span
  class="sc">Cerastes</span> or <span class="sc">Horned Viper</span> of Egypt, and the large and
  most repulsive and deadly African <span class="sc">Puff-adder</span>. The <span class="sc">Common
  Viper</span> or <span class="sc">Adder</span>, the only poisonous British snake, has a very
  extensive geographical distribution, extending throughout Europe and Asia as far east as the
  island of Saghalien, and northwards to the Arctic Circle. The <span class="sc">Horned Viper</span>
  of the Sahara and North Africa is one of the most venomous of living serpents. Lying buried
  beneath the sand, with only its head above, it will spring aggressively at any animal which passes
  by, and the action of its venom is so rapid that a horse or man bitten by it usually dies within
  half an hour. In colour the horned viper closely resembles the sand or stony wastes among which it
  lies. The most remarkable feature in this snake is the presence of two elevated horn-like
  processes immediately above the eyes, which are most prominent in the male. The species has
  frequently been on view at the Zoological Society's Gardens. On one occasion an ostensible example
  was purchased and deposited in the Reptile-house, which proved on nearer investigation to be a
  base imposition. A common desert-viper had been cleverly manipulated by the deft insertion of
  suitably shaped <span class="pagenum" id="page597"><span
  class="smaller">{597}</span></span>splinters of wood into its head, so that it resembled the rarer
  horned variety. The <span class="sc">Puff-adder</span>, the largest member of its tribe, may
  attain to a length of 6 feet or more, and is distributed throughout the African Continent. Its
  thick body is almost triangular in section, the head very large, flat, and bluntly rounded
  anteriorly, while the eyes have a particularly fierce, stony, and repulsive aspect. In colour
  individuals vary considerably, but there is generally a chequered pattern of reds, browns, and
  greys, disposed in the form of darker and lighter alternating crescent-shaped bands along the
  back. The poison of this snake is nearly as virulent as that of the horned viper, and is commonly
  used by the African bushmen for poisoning their arrows.</p>

  <p>The Viperine group is abundantly represented in the New World, where its members differ from
  the typical Old World species in sundry anatomical points, one of the most conspicuous features
  being the presence of a distinct depression or pit in the surface of the head between the nostril
  and the eye on either side. On this account they are distinguished by the title of <span
  class="sc">Pit-vipers</span>. Among the more familiar representatives of this group are the <span
  class="sc">Rattle-snakes</span>, the <span class="sc">Fer-de-lance</span>, the <span
  class="sc">Bush-master</span>, and the <span class="sc">Copper-head</span> or <span
  class="sc">Mocassin-snakes</span>. All these are notoriously venomous, fatal effects from bites
  received by human subjects being of frequent recurrence. The <span class="sc">Rattle-snakes</span>
  are especially distinguished by the peculiar, loosely jointed, horny appendage to their tails, by
  the rapid vibration of which, when disturbed, they fortunately give timely notice of their
  presence. In the young individuals this rattle is only represented by a single button-like knob,
  additional loose, hollow, horny rings being added between it and the scaly termination of the tail
  as age increases. In full-grown examples the horny rings composing the rattle may number as many
  as twenty or more, though, owing to the war of extermination incessantly levied against these
  reptiles in all civilised areas, it is rarely that such elaborate rattle-bearers are now met with.
  The rattle-snake, in the more northern districts of its distribution, hibernates in the winter,
  often congregating together in great numbers for the sake of the mutual warmth. In the earlier
  days certain caves were famous as the retreats into which not only hundreds but thousands of the
  reptiles would congregate from the country round for their winter's slumber. At such times
  hunting-parties were specially organised for their wholesale destruction, and accomplished much
  towards reducing their ranks to their present numbers.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In addition to the common North American rattle-snake there are some four or five other species
  distributed throughout the Southern States, Mexico, and Panama. None appear to exceed a length of
  6 feet. In South America their place is to a large extent taken <span class="pagenum"
  id="page598"><span class="smaller">{598}</span></span>by the so-called <span
  class="sc">Bush-master</span>, a snake which attains to a length of as much as from 9 to 12 feet,
  and, in addition to being exceedingly venomous, is of an especially fierce and aggressive
  disposition. It is devoid of a rattle-like appendage, the tail terminating in a sharp horny spine.
  The <span class="sc">Fer-de-lance</span>, or <span class="sc">Rat-tailed Pit-viper</span>, is
  another Central and South American species, held in wholesome dread on account of its
  death-dealing potentialities. The South American sugar-plantations are an especially favourite
  resort of this deadly snake, its attraction being the rats which frequent the canes and afford its
  chief food. Lying concealed among the thick foliage, it will launch itself aggressively at any
  passer-by, and its bite is usually attended with fatal results within a few hours. The
  fer-de-lance grows to a length of 6 or 7 or occasionally even 8 feet, with a thickness of a man's
  arm. Its colours, as with most members of its tribe, are somewhat variable. The ground-colour of
  the back is usually olive or reddish brown, with dark cross-bands; a black stripe runs backwards
  from the eye to the neck, and in some instances the sides of the body are bright red.</p>

  <p>The Amphibian Class, through the Newts and Salamanders more especially, would appear at first
  sight to have much in common with and to be most closely allied to the Lizards, previously
  described. As a matter of fact, however, the group is much more nearly related to the Fishes.
  Quite the most characteristic feature in the Amphibians that is indicative of the above-mentioned
  affinity is the circumstance that for a more or less longer period of their existence their
  respiratory organs take the form of external gills, structures not found in any of the preceding
  vertebrate classes. Another diagnostic character of the <span class="pagenum" id="page599"><span
  class="smaller">{599}</span></span>Amphibia is afforded by the circumstance that they all pass
  through a transitional or larval condition before arriving at the adult state. The familiar
  tadpole phase of the common frog or toad typically illustrates this point. During its earliest
  larval state the fish-like resemblance is especially conspicuous. In addition to possessing gills,
  the body is limbless, and produced into a long fish-like tail, having superior and inferior
  fin-like membranes, with which the little animal propels itself through the water. These
  locomotive fins, however, are never furnished with supporting fin-rays, as obtains among the
  Fishes. In contradistinction to the Lizards and Snakes, the skin of Amphibians is never covered
  with spines or scales, but is soft and naked. In many of the Toads and Salamanders the surface of
  the skin is, however, warted and highly glandular, and capable of emitting an acrid and sometimes
  poisonous fluid. More or less pronounced conditions of moisture are essential for the well-being
  of all Amphibians. The eggs are deposited, and the earlier or larval conditions, with but few
  exceptions, passed, in the water, while the adults remain in its near proximity, and frequently
  take up their abode in it. Amphibia do not, however, drink water after the manner of lizards and
  other reptiles, but absorb all the moisture they require through the surface of their skins. The
  deeper and more essential skeletal elements of the Amphibia differ conspicuously from those of the
  preceding groups. The vertebr&aelig; in the permanently gill-bearing species more particularly are
  scarcely to be distinguished from those of fishes. In the Frog and Toad Tribe, on the other hand,
  they are reduced to a less number, seven or eight only, than is found among any other vertebrates,
  while ribs do not exist or are rudimentary and functionless throughout the class. Many bones of
  the skull in the Amphibia, as well as its general construction, are more in accord with those of
  fishes than of ordinary reptiles. The tongue, not always present, is attached immediately inside
  the front of the lower jaw, its tip pointing down the animal's throat. It is remarkable that,
  notwithstanding their aquatic proclivities, no Amphibian has been discovered which frequents salt
  water.</p>

  <p>Amphibians amongst themselves constitute two very easily recognised sub-divisions,&mdash;the
  one including the Frogs and Toads, collectively forming the Tailless group; and the other
  represented by the Newts and Salamanders, or Tailed Amphibians. The former group has an almost
  world-wide distribution, numbering some thousand species; it is most abundantly represented in the
  tropics, ranging thence in diminishing numbers to the limits of the Arctic Circle. In colder
  climates these Amphibia usually hibernate during the winter months; while in tropical countries,
  where dry seasons intervene, they often bury themselves in the mud, and remain in a state of
  torpor till the return of the rains. The majority are more or less essentially nocturnal in their
  habits. Frogs and toads commence life in an aquatic <span class="pagenum" id="page600"><span
  class="smaller">{600}</span></span>tadpole phase. While in the adult state they are strictly
  carnivorous, the tadpoles are vegetarian feeders.</p>

  <p>The section to which the <span class="sc">Common British Frog</span> belongs includes nearly
  150 species, collectively known as Water-frogs, which present considerable differences in both
  their aspect and habits. While some are perennially aquatic, others only resort to the water
  during the breeding-season; some are terrestrial and occasionally earth-burrowers, while yet
  another series is essentially arboreal.</p>

  <p>In addition to the familiar British species the much-esteemed <span class="sc">Edible
  Frog</span> of the Continent has become acclimatised in England. A dark-coloured race of this
  frog, supposed to have been introduced by the monks centuries since on account of its esculent
  properties, is plentiful in the fens of Cambridgeshire, while a greener race of the same species
  was imported to and established in Norfolk somewhere about the year 1840. The edible frog may be
  distinguished from the common species by the more complete webbing of its hind feet, the absence
  of the dark so-called temporal spot that extends from the eye to the shoulder, and the presence in
  the males of a globular sac on each side of the head, which confers upon them louder croaking
  powers than are possessed by the common species.</p>

  <p>The loudest-voiced as well as almost the largest member of this group is the <span
  class="sc">Bull-frog</span> of Canada and the United States. The length of the body in this
  species may be as much as from 7 to 7&frac12; inches, exclusive of the legs; and its croakings, or more
  correctly bellowings, are so loud that it may be heard for a distance of several miles. These
  croakings are most pronounced during the early spring or breeding-season. In the Southern United
  States, however, they are maintained more or less persistently throughout the year. While the
  British frog contents itself with a diet of slugs, worms, beetles, and other insects, the
  bull-frog aspires to larger quarry, and has an especial penchant for young ducklings. As a
  compensation the flesh of the bull-frog is said to be very delicately flavoured, and the species
  is so much esteemed in some localities as to be kept in captivity and fattened for the table. It
  has been recorded that the bull-frog makes leaps of from 8 to 10 feet in length and 5 feet in
  height.</p>

  <p>In point of size the bull-frog is somewhat eclipsed by a species discovered in the Solomon
  Islands, and known as <span class="sc">Guppy's Frog</span>. This huge frog has a body no less than
  9 inches in length. It has not been recorded whether its vocal powers are proportionately loud.
  Another large species allied to the Bull-frogs is found in South and East Africa, whose flesh is
  attested to by Dr. Livingstone as being excellent eating and resembling chicken when cooked. This
  frog, known to the natives as the <span class="sc">Matlamitlo</span>, is supposed by them to fall
  from the clouds, on account of its sudden appearance in even the driest parts of the desert
  immediately after a thunder-storm. The species, however, is in the habit of making holes at the
  roots of bushes, <span class="pagenum" id="page601"><span class="smaller">{601}</span></span>into
  which it retires during the months of drought, rushing out into the hollows filled by the
  thunder-showers while the rain is still actually falling. Even during the long drought these frogs
  continue their croakings from their retreats at night, and are very misleading to travellers, who
  customarily associate their presence with the immediate neighbourhood of water.</p>

  <p>There is a remarkable difference in the voice-timbre of the various species of frogs. In
  England, with its one indigenous variety, comparisons cannot be instituted. In countries, however,
  like Australia, where numbers of species live in close proximity, the phenomenon is very marked.
  Some only give voice in the evening or night, while others keep up their clamour throughout the
  day; with some the note is metallic and almost bell-like, while one diurnal croaking species,
  which congregates in great numbers in the eastern Tasmanian coast district, emits a loud
  percussive note closely resembling that of a stone-breaker's hammer. On several occasions, in
  fact, when driving through the areas these frogs frequented, the impression produced by their
  croaking was so realistic that the next turn in the road was expected to reveal the presence of a
  large gang of road-makers engaged in negotiating a wayside stone-heap.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable species is the <span class="sc">Flying-frog</span> of Java. The
  power of flight is simulated in this instance on a different principle to that which obtains in
  any other group. It is not accomplished through the medium of abnormally produced ribs with
  connecting membrane, as occurs in the Flying-lizards; nor by means of a flap of skin stretched
  between the fore and hind limbs, as in the Flying-squirrels and Phalangers. In place of these the
  toes of all four feet are abnormally prolonged, and their interspaces bridged over to their tips
  by webbing. The body of this frog is about 4 inches long, while the webs of the feet, when fully
  expanded, cover collectively an area of fully 12 square inches; they thus constitute aerial
  floats, which enable their owner to make prodigiously long flying leaps among the trees in which
  it takes up its abode. The colours of this singular species are striking; the back and limbs are a
  deep shining green, the under-surface and inner toes yellow, and the webs black rayed with yellow.
  In common with the typical Tree-frogs, the toes of this Javan flying variety all terminate in a
  dilated adhesive disk.</p>

  <p>Among the oddities of the Frog Tribe prominence may be given to the singular <span
  class="sc">Short-headed Frogs</span> of East Africa. In these the head is so short, and the body,
  when puffed out, so nearly globular, that they have been aptly described as more nearly resembling
  india-rubber balls than frogs. Another notable form, inhabiting Chili, is remarkable for the
  circumstance that the throat-sac of the male is so enlarged and modified as to form a chamber on
  the under <span class="pagenum" id="page602"><span class="smaller">{602}</span></span>surface of
  the body. In this sac the eggs laid by the female are deposited and pass through their tadpole
  phases.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Horned Frogs</span>, or <span class="sc">Horned Toads</span>, of South
  America constitute a distinct and interesting group. They are of large size, stout and rotund,
  gorgeously apparelled, and truculent in bearing. There are nearly a dozen known species, the
  distinctive feature from which they take their name having reference to the stiff, horn-like
  development of their upper eyelids. The largest species is a native of Brazil, whose body may be
  as much as 8 inches long. This species has the horn-like processes of the eyelids most prominently
  developed. A somewhat smaller but conspicuously handsome species, plentiful in the Argentine
  Republic, is at the present time represented by several individuals at the Regent's Park Gardens.
  In this animal the body is relatively more obese and toad-like than in the Brazilian form, but the
  horn-like angle of the upper eyelid is only slightly produced. The colours vary somewhat, the
  general ground-tint of the upper-surface is bronze-green or yellow, upon which are distributed
  large spots and blotches of dark olive or chocolate, having light yellow or golden margins. The
  spots on the limbs are the widest, and almost take the character of cross-bands. Bright claret-red
  lines are sometimes developed in and among the body-spots.</p>

  <p>A very interesting account of the habits of this frog appears in Mr. W. H. Hudson's "The
  Naturalist in La Plata." Mr. Hudson reports it as being common on the pampas as far south as the
  Rio Colorado, in Patagonia. In the breeding-season it congregates in pools, and displays
  extraordinary vocal powers, which are exercised at night. The notes uttered are long, resembling
  those of a wind instrument, and are so powerful that on still evenings they may be heard
  distinctly a mile off. After the pairing-season the frogs disperse, and, retiring to moist places,
  bury themselves just deep enough to leave their broad green backs on a level with the surface. The
  eyes, under these conditions, look out as from a couple of watch-towers, and are on the <i>qui
  vive</i> for any approaching prey. This consists of any moving creature which they can capture,
  such as other frogs and toads, birds, and small mammals. In very wet seasons they will frequent
  the neighbourhood of houses, and lie in wait for chickens and ducklings, often capturing and
  attempting to swallow objects much too large for them. In disposition they are exceedingly
  pugnacious, savagely biting at anything that comes near them. When teased, the creature swells
  itself out to such an extent that one expects to see it burst. It follows its tormentors about
  with slow, awkward leaps, its vast mouth wide open, and uttering an incessant harsh croaking
  sound. When they bite, these frogs hold on with the tenacity of a bull-dog, poisoning the blood of
  the creature seized with their glandular secretion. Mr. Hudson records two instances in which to
  his knowledge horses were killed through being bitten by a horned frog. One of them, while lying
  down, had been seized by a fold in the skin near the belly; the other had been grasped by the nose
  while cropping grass. In both instances the vicious frog was found dead, with jaws tightly closed,
  still hanging to the dead horse. "It would seem," Mr. Hudson remarks, "that they are sometimes
  incapable of letting go at will, and, like honey-bees, destroy themselves in these savage
  attacks."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page603"><span class="smaller">{603}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Tree-frogs</span> represent one of the most distinct groups of the tribe.
  All its members are more or less arboreal in their habits, repairing to the water only during the
  breeding-season, or leaving the trees to seek shelter in the earth or underneath stones or timber
  for the purposes of hibernation. As an adaptation for their special habits, the toes of the
  tree-frogs are provided at their tips with suctorial disks, so that they can walk on perpendicular
  or smoothly glazed surfaces after the manner of the Geckos among the Lizards. Another
  characteristic feature is the development on the under surface of their bodies of peculiar
  granular glands pierced by numerous pores, through the medium of which they rapidly absorb the
  moisture deposited by dew or rain on the surfaces of the leaves among which they live. The colours
  of the tree-frogs harmonise, as a rule, so completely with those of their leafy environments that
  their presence very readily escapes detection. Many of the species, moreover, rival the cham&aelig;leon
  in their capacity of quickly adapting their tints to that of a newly occupied surrounding. Green
  is naturally the dominant ground-tint of these frogs. Often, however, it is intermixed with
  stripes and bands of other colours, while sometimes the green hue is entirely replaced, as in the
  <span class="sc">Blue</span> or <span class="sc">Bicoloured Tree-frog</span> of South America,
  which is brilliant azure above and pure white beneath. A very beautiful Australian species,
  abundant in Tasmania and Victoria, and appropriately named the <span class="sc">Golden
  Tree-frog</span>, has its grass-green overcoat thickly overlaid and embroidered with, as it were,
  the purest beaten gold.</p>

  <p>One small species of tree-frog is common on the European Continent, its distribution extending
  to North Africa and eastward throughout Asia north of the Himalaya to Japan. The species is
  imported into England in considerable numbers, and readily becomes acclimatised in a conservatory.
  Green above and whitish beneath constitute the prevailing tints of this species, such uniformity
  being, however, varied by the presence of a darker, often nearly black, light-edged streak, that
  extends from the snout through the eye and ear along each side of the body, and sends a branch
  upwards and forwards on the loins. The male of this European species shares with many others of
  its tribe the possession of a large external vocal sac, which when inflated bulges out from the
  throat in a spherical form to dimensions little inferior to those of the creature's body. It may
  be <span class="pagenum" id="page604"><span class="smaller">{604}</span></span>observed of
  examples of these frogs acclimatised in a conservatory that the falling of heavy rain on the roof
  is an almost certain incentive to their croakings. By pouring water resonantly from a little
  height into another vessel, the writer also found that he could produce a frog chorus at
  command.</p>

  <p>The European and other tree-frogs deposit their eggs in the water, some species constructing a
  symmetrical crater-like nest of mud for the reception of the eggs and tadpoles. Certain kinds,
  however, never leave the trees, having adapted their requirements to the naturally provided
  environments. Thus one Brazilian species deposits its eggs in the water almost invariably
  contained in the central cup of a tree, while another allied frog chooses for the same purpose the
  moist interstices at the bases of decaying banana leaves. A step further, resulting in complete
  independence of external water, is arrived at by the <span class="sc">Marsupial</span> or <span
  class="sc">Pouched Tree-frog</span> of Central America. In this species the female develops a
  capacious pouch on her back, which opens backward, and wherein both the eggs&mdash;primarily
  assisted to their position by the male&mdash;and tadpoles undergo their characteristic
  transformations.</p>

  <p>As a contrast to the foregoing exclusively tree-dwelling forms, one very fine species common in
  Queensland has pronounced social proclivities. He is a fine fellow, with a bright pea-green coat
  and large, lustrous black eyes, and either with or without your leave invades your bedroom from
  the adjoining verandah, and makes the lip of your water-jug his headquarters. Here he will "lie
  low" the livelong day. With the approach of night, however, this lethargy is thrown aside, and he
  hops forth, making excursions through every room in search of black-beetles, spiders, moths, or
  other acceptable quarry. In this vermin-destroying capacity he is a welcome guest to all except
  perhaps the ultra-squeamish housekeeper, his occasional offence of an upset glass or cup during
  his excited chase of the wily cockroach being readily condoned. He has a playful habit too, during
  his midnight wanderings, of climbing up walls and ceilings, to which he readily clings with his
  adhesive toes, and mayhap drops down on the recumbent form of some peaceful sleeper, who, if a
  stranger, possibly wakes with an alarming apprehension of snakes or other uncanny intruders. When
  once this <span class="sc">Queensland Green Frog</span> has determined upon his camping-ground, he
  clings to it with remarkable pertinacity. You may deport him time after time, and even carry him
  half a day's journey into the wilderness, but he turns up again the next morning or the following
  one.</p>

  <p>Toads are distinguished from frogs by their sluggish creeping movements and by their
  non-possession of teeth. There are over eighty species, having collectively an almost cosmopolitan
  range, though they are not found in Australia, New Guinea, Madagascar, or the Pacific Islands. The
  common British species enjoys a wide distribution, being found throughout Europe, Asia excepting
  India, and North-west Africa. Its somewhat clumsy, brown, wrinkled, and warted body, with darker
  spots and markings on the upper-surface and white-speckled under-surface, will be familiar to
  every reader. With many it is an unwarranted <span class="pagenum" id="page605"><span
  class="smaller">{605}</span></span>object of aversion, and in country districts is not
  infrequently accredited with venomous properties. Toad-spawn is plentiful in ponds and ditches in
  the early spring, and may be distinguished from that of the frog by the fact of its being
  deposited in chain-like strings, the eggs being arranged in a double alternating row, instead of
  in irregular masses, as obtains with the last-named species. The individual eggs are, moreover,
  smaller, and deposited two or three weeks later in the season than those of the frog. A second and
  somewhat rarer British toad is known as the <span class="sc">Natterjack</span>. It may be
  distinguished from the ordinary species by the shorter hind limbs, the more prominent eyes, and
  the conspicuous yellow line down the middle of its back. It is also somewhat more active than the
  common species.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The last member of the group which demands brief notice is the singular <span
  class="sc">Water-toad</span> of Surinam. This animal, also known as the <span
  class="sc">Pipa</span>, is an inhabitant of the moist forest regions of the Guianas and Central
  America, and remarkable on account of the singular phenomena connected with its breeding habits.
  The eggs, from 60 to over 100 in number, are deposited by the female in the water in the ordinary
  manner, but at this stage they are taken in hand by the male and literally planted in the back of
  the female, whose skin in this region becomes abnormally soft and thickened at this season. The
  young toads undergo their complete development in the parental integument, each egg and its
  resulting embryo occupying a separate primarily cylindrical chamber, which by lateral pressure
  becomes hexagonal, resembling a honeycomb-cell. Eighty-two days are occupied from the time of the
  deposition of the eggs until the young toads emerge into the outer world, their appearance as they
  make their <i>d&eacute;but</i>, with here a head and there one or it may be two limbs thrust out from the
  surface of the parent's back, being highly grotesque.</p>

  <p>The Newts and Salamanders, or Tailed Amphibians, are distinguished from the preceding group of
  the Frogs and Toads by the retention of a tail throughout life. In this manner they very nearly
  resemble the advanced larval or tadpole phases of the latter. In some instances, in fact, the
  earlier or externally gill-bearing tadpole phase is persistent. The geographical distribution of
  the Salamander Tribe is much less extensive than that of the Frogs and Toads, but few are found
  south of the Equator, and they are entirely unknown in Australia or in Africa south of the
  Sahara.</p>

  <p>Two members of the group are indigenous to the British Islands, where they are familiarly known
  as <span class="sc">Newts</span>, <span class="sc">Askers</span>, <span class="sc">Effets</span>,
  or <span class="sc">Efts</span>. The larger and handsomer of the two, the <span class="sc">Crested
  Newt</span>, occurs in ponds and ditches throughout the warmer months of the year. It grows to a
  length of nearly 6 inches, of which the tail constitutes about one moiety. Its <span
  class="pagenum" id="page606"><span class="smaller">{606}</span></span>colour is more usually
  blackish or olive-brown with darker circular spots above, and yellow or orange-red with black
  spots or marbling beneath, while the sides are speckled white. In the breeding-season the colours
  are more especially brilliant, and it is at this time that the male develops the serrated crest
  along the middle of its back, from which it takes its title.</p>

      <p class="sp3">SMOOTH NEWT.</p>
      <p class="sp0">This species often travels long distances from water, taking up its residence
      in damp cellars and vaults.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The eggs, or spawn, of the newt are deposited in a different fashion to those of the frog and
  toad. In place of being aggregated together in an irregular or ribbon-like mass, each is deposited
  separately and attached to the leaves of water-plants. By the dexterous use of its feet, the
  female newt twists or folds the leaf, or a portion of it, around the egg, its viscid envelope
  allowing it to readily adhere, and it is thus effectually concealed or protected from injury. When
  about a quarter of a inch long, the tadpole escapes from the egg. At this early stage the gills
  are quite simple and the front limbs represented by mere knobs. Immediately in front of the gills
  are two fleshy lobes, by means of which the tadpole can temporarily adhere to the surfaces of
  water-plants. Within a fortnight the little animal has grown to double the size. The gills are now
  elegantly branched and the fore limbs well developed. The latter are, however, only bifurcated at
  their extremities, and it is some little time later that four distinct toes are possessed by each
  fore limb and that the hind limbs make their appearance. The gills, which have at this stage
  reached their most complex state of development, now begin to diminish in size, and are gradually
  absorbed, the lungs in the meantime acquiring their full functional proportions. The newt, having
  now passed from the fish-like to a reptilian stage, is unable to live entirely beneath the water,
  and is obliged to come up to the surface at intervals to breathe, or is adapted for living
  entirely upon land. Newts in their fully matured state, except during the breeding-season, pass
  much of their time on land, and wander to considerable distances from the water. They at all
  times, however, exhibit a preference for moist situations, such as a shady wood or damp
  cellar.</p>

  <p>Like the toad and blind-worm, the feeble, inoffensive newt has from the earliest time to the
  present day been the victim of the most unmerited dread and persecution among the uneducated. In
  some country districts it is not only accredited with the property of biting venomously, but of
  spitting fire into the bitten wound. A property that is actually possessed by these creatures is
  that of reproducing lost parts. The Geckos and other lizards, as already recorded, are in the
  habit of reproducing their mutilated tails. The newt, however, beats that record to the extent of
  reproducing lost legs, and, it has been affirmed, eyes also.</p>

  <p>A second species of British newt, of somewhat smaller size and even more common than the
  crested one, is the <span class="sc">Common</span> or <span class="sc">Smooth Newt</span>. It
  scarcely exceeds 3 inches in length, and is distinguished by its smooth skin and relatively less
  conspicuous crest. In habits it is less addicted to a prolonged aquatic residence than the crested
  form, and wanders to more considerable distances from water. One of the largest and handsomest
  representatives of the family is the <span class="sc">Marbled Newt</span> of Southern France and
  the Spanish Peninsula, which attains a length of 8 or 9 inches. The upper-parts of the male at the
  breeding-season are bright bronze-green with irregular black markings; its crest is ornamented
  with black and white vertical bars, and a silvery white band is developed along the sides of the
  tail. The crestless female has a distinctive orange streak running down the centre of the
  back.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">True Salamanders</span> have no British representative, though the common
  or spotted species <span class="pagenum" id="page607"><span class="smaller">{607}</span></span>is
  abundant throughout Central and Southern Europe. Its conspicuous livery&mdash;in which bold
  markings of black and brilliant yellow are somewhat equally balanced, no two individuals, however,
  precisely corresponding&mdash;distinguishes it broadly from all other members of the group. The
  surface of the skin is very smooth and shining, and thickly set on the surface with glands and
  pores, from which a viscid and undoubtedly poisonous secretion is exuded. In common with that of
  other salamanders, the tail is cylindrical, instead of compressed and oar-shaped, as in the Newts,
  and there is no crest down the back. The <span class="sc">Spotted Salamander</span> frequents
  moist situations in mountain and forest districts. It is essentially nocturnal in its habits,
  lying up during the day in some suitable rock or mossy crevice, exposure of its sensitive skin to
  the direct rays of the sun speedily having a fatal effect. Large numbers of this salamander are
  sold as suitable and curious additions to the fernery and vivarium, and will survive for long
  periods, appropriate food and the necessary conditions of moisture being provided. Snails, worms,
  and beetles and other insects constituting its natural food, it fulfils as useful a r&ocirc;le as the
  toad in the extermination of insect-pests, and may be as strongly recommended for introduction to
  the greenhouse.</p>

  <p>The colossus of the tailed Amphibian race is the <span class="sc">Giant Salamander</span> of
  China and Japan, which may attain to a length of from 3 to 3&frac12; feet. The body, like that of the
  ordinary salamanders, is broad and depressed; but the eyes are very small, and have no eyelids;
  and the tail, which is relatively short, is compressed, and has a fin both above and beneath. This
  salamander lives entirely in the water, and is adapted for such an aquatic life by the possession
  of both lungs and gills. In its native habitat it is most usually found in small, clear
  mountain-streams, at elevations of from 700 to 5,000 feet above the sea-level, such streams being
  often not more than a foot in width, and more or less overgrown with grasses; in these the adults
  are usually found curled round the larger stones, while the smaller ones occupy holes and crevices
  among them.</p>

  <p>A representative of the tribe now commonly kept in aquaria is the Mexican <span
  class="sc">Axolotl</span>. It has usually a velvety black skin, and grows to a length of 9 or 10
  inches. As generally known it presents a very newt-like aspect, or, more correctly, that advanced
  tadpole state of the newt in which the external gills are most highly developed. The animals breed
  freely in the water, eggs being laid, which pass through the earlier tadpole to the adult phase.
  Up to within comparatively recent times the foregoing metamorphoses were supposed to represent the
  Alpha and Omega of the animal's existence. Some exceptional examples, however, bred in an aquarium
  in which rocks projected out of the water, surprised their owners by gradually absorbing their
  supposed persistent gills, also their fin-like tail-membranes, and, crawling out on the rocks,

  caves of Dalmatia and Carniola is a form with persistent external gills. Nearly allied is the
  North American form known as the <span class="sc">Furrowed Salamander</span>. The latter, however,
  living under more normal conditions, has well-developed eyes. While possessing the customary
  number of limbs, the number of toes in the American type is four to each foot. In the European
  Proteus there are but three toes to the front and two toes to the hinder limb. In a yet lower
  form, the <span class="sc">Siren Salamander</span> of the South-eastern United States, a yet more
  primitive persistently gill-bearing condition is presented.</p>

  <p>Though amongst the lowest of the backboned animals, the Fishes are nevertheless an exceedingly
  interesting group, distinguished from all others by the possession of fins, which are divisible
  into two series,&mdash;an unpaired, ranged along the middle of the back and abdomen, and including
  the tail-fin; and a paired series, representing the fore and hind limbs of land animals. The body
  is either clothed with scales or naked, and, being perfectly sustained by the water, needs no
  support from the fins, which serve as balancing-organs.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the brilliancy and beauty of their coloration fishes display a variety that
  cannot be excelled by any other animals. Furthermore, the coloration is often rendered still more
  beautiful from the fact that it can undergo rapid changes of hue. Frequently this coloration is of
  a protective character, causing the fish to harmonise with its surroundings, and so escape the
  observation of its enemies. The colours of living fishes can only, for the most part, be indicated
  in the present pages when a pattern exists by the formation of stripes or spots; but the wonderful
  variations in the form of the body will probably prove a revelation to many.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Lung-fishes.</span></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Lung-fishes</span> are a peculiarly important group, inasmuch as they form
  a connecting-link between the class Fishes and the land-dwelling Amphibians&mdash;the class
  containing the Frogs and Toads and their allies. They are accorded this position mainly because,
  like Amphibians, they possess true lungs, which almost entirely replace the gills, the
  breathing-organs of other fishes.</p>

  <p>One of the best known of the lung-fishes is the <span class="sc">Australian Barramundi</span>,
  or <span class="sc">Lung-fish of Queensland</span>&mdash;the <span class="sc">Burnett</span> or
  <span class="sc">Dawson Salmon</span> of the settlers. It lives among the weeds at the bottom of
  muddy rivers, rising frequently to the surface to take in atmospheric air by the lungs, the gills
  alone being insufficient for breathing purposes. The flesh, which is salmon-coloured, is much
  esteemed as food. The adult fish is said to attain to a weight of 20 lbs. and a length of 6
  feet.</p>

  <p>Other lung-fishes, eel-like in form, occur in the rivers of Africa and South America. The <span
  class="pagenum" id="page610"><span class="smaller">{610}</span></span>African species is perhaps
  the better known of the two. On the approach of the dry season it buries itself in the mud at the
  bottom of the river, and when the latter becomes dry the mud hardens, holding the fish a prisoner
  till the return of the wet season several months later. A considerable number of these fishes have
  from time to time been dug out and sent to England enclosed in the mud into which they had
  retreated. The writer remembers assisting in the liberation of some during the last meeting of the
  British Association at Oxford. So hard had the prison-walls become that the mass had to be plunged
  into tepid water; this soon brought about a dissolution of the soil, and in a short time the
  fishes were swimming about as if in their native rivers. The African lung-fish is known also as
  the <span class="sc">Mud-fish</span>; its American relative as the <span
  class="sc">Lepidosiren</span>, or <span class="sc">South American Mud-fish</span>. In the American
  species, as in its African relative, the fins are whip-like in form; but the hinder or ventral
  pair, which correspond to the hind limbs of the higher vertebrated animals, are remarkable in that
  in the male they develop during the breeding-season numerous thread-like processes, richly
  supplied with blood, the function of which is as yet unknown.</p>

  <p>The young, both of the African and South American mud-fishes, bear external gills closely
  resembling those of the tadpoles of the frog and other Amphibia; traces of these gills remain
  throughout life in the African form.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Shark-like in their general characters, the <span class="sc">Chim&aelig;ras</span>, now briefly
  considered, are nevertheless regarded as constituting a very distinct group of great
  antiquity.</p>

  <p>The modern representatives of the group are few in number&mdash;five species in all. Of these,
  the species shown in the accompanying photograph and the <span class="sc">Sea-cat</span> are
  remarkable for the possession of a movable tentacle on the snout. The under surface of this
  tentacle is armed with small spines, and fits into a hollow in the head. The first back-fin is
  supported in front by a strong spine, and can be depressed into a sheath in the body-walls. The
  teeth take the form of large plates closely united with the jaws, and studded with hardened
  points, or "tritors."</p>

  <p>One species widely distributed in the Mediterranean and Atlantic is taken usually in deep
  water; it is the largest living species, often attaining a yard in length. Its occurrence is,
  however, very erratic, months elapsing without any being taken; at other times several will be
  caught in a few days. A closely allied fish is often exposed for sale in the Lisbon markets, where
  it ranks with the Sharks as a food-fish.</p>

  <p>The egg of the <span class="sc">Bottle-nosed Chim&aelig;ra</span> is perhaps the only egg with a
  mimetic resemblance to a foreign object. It is elliptical in form, and bordered by a fringe, so as
  to present a close resemblance to a piece of seaweed.</p>

  <p>In the next chapter we begin the description of the great group of Fan- and Fringe-finned
  Fishes, which, briefly, embrace all fishes not grouped among the Lung-fishes, Chim&aelig;ras, or Sharks.
  The anatomical characters used for the purpose of classifying this great group are not discussed
  here, save only in a few cases of prime importance, when features such as can readily be observed,
  without demanding an intimate knowledge of anatomy, are selected.</p>

  <p>The thick-set, golden-bronze, dark-barred, hog-backed fish known as the <span
  class="sc">Perch</span> has many striking characteristics, and is remarkable, among other things,
  for the vast number of its relations scattered all over the world. So numerous, indeed, are its
  cousins that ichthyologists have had to divide the Perch Family into a large number of groups.
  There are various species of perch found, as a matter of fact, in the fresh-waters and on all the
  coasts of the temperate and tropical regions.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Common Perch</span>, which is widely distributed over Europe, Northern
  Asia, and North America, is properly an inhabitant of rivers, lakes, and ponds, but sometimes
  descends to brackish water. It runs up to about 5 lbs. in weight, and is carnivorous, eating most
  kinds of fish small enough for its swallow, including the fry of its own species, which are, in
  some waters, an excellent bait.</p>

  <p>In England perch spawn in the spring, the eggs being held in a band-like mass of gelatinous
  matter deposited on weeds or the roots of trees not far below the surface of the water. The spawn,
  as a matter of fact, is often collected by fish-culturists and hatched out. Swans and water-fowl
  generally eat the eggs by the million, and wherever perch are preserved these birds should, so far
  as possible, be kept from the water during the spawning-season. At Henley and other places on the
  Thames those interested in fishery preservation place wire netting round the boughs and weeds
  where perch have spawned, to prevent the eggs being eaten by swans and ducks.</p>

  <p>Among the species of perch found in British waters are the <span class="sc">Ruffe</span>, or
  <span class="sc">Pope</span>, a very small and common river-fish of no great value; the <span
  class="sc">Bass</span>, a fine sporting sea-fish, which comes up the estuaries of rivers to spawn,

  <p class="sp5">On the Continent there is the <span class="sc">Pike-perch</span>, a fish having the

  <p>For quaintness of shape, combined with beauty of coloration, the family of Scaly-finned Fishes
  has no rivals. The name by which they are collectively known refers to the scaly covering which
  invests the bases of what are called the median fins&mdash;the fins seated along the middle of the
  back and abdomen. A large number of distinct species have been described, the majority of which
  occur in tropical seas, and especially in the neighbourhood of coral-reefs; but some frequent the
  mouths of rivers, which they occasionally ascend for a short distance. All are of relatively small
  size, of carnivorous habits, and but little used for food.</p>

  <p>The pattern of coloration commonly takes the form of bands or stripes, those in which this
  pattern is most marked being known as <span class="sc">Zebra-fish</span>. One of the most
  beautiful is the <span class="pagenum" id="page614"><span class="smaller">{614}</span></span><span
  class="sc">Emperor-fish</span>, which ranges from the east coast of Africa to the Indian and
  Malayan seas. The ground-colour of the body is deep blue, relieved by some thirty golden-yellow
  stripes running from the shoulder backwards to the tail. Crossing the head is a crescent-shaped
  bar of black edged with yellow, whilst a similarly coloured patch runs upward from the pectoral
  fins to within a short distance of the top of the back. This species, which attains a length of 15
  inches, is highly esteemed for food in India. The most beautiful of all, perhaps, is the
  zebra-fish of the Indo-Malayan seas, which has the ground-colour of yellow, striped with vertical
  bars of blue edged with brown, a yellow tail, and an anal fin barred with narrow blue lines.</p>

      <p class="sp0">So named on account of its supposed habit of shooting water at insects.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A tubed-shaped mouth is a common feature of the fishes of this group, and two Indian species in
  which this character is especially well developed have acquired the habit of shooting therefrom a
  drop of water at insects resting on overhanging foliage fringing the sea or along the banks of
  rivers. Having sighted its quarry, it would seem the fish moves upwards to the surface of the
  water, and with careful aim ejects its liquid bullet with such unerring precision that its prey is
  invariably knocked down and speedily seized. On this account these fishes are commonly known as
  <span class="sc">Archer-fishes</span>. The archer-fishes are sometimes kept in tubs of water, for
  the purpose of affording amusement to their captors. Somehow the shooting prowess of these fishes
  has been accredited to an allied form, shown in the above photograph.</p>

  <p>The peculiar shape of these fishes is sufficiently indicated by the photograph already
  mentioned, but a large series would be necessary to show the numerous variations, some of which
  are quite remarkable. The brilliancy of the coloration is probably protective, since the most
  brightly coloured forms live amongst coral-reefs built by gorgeous polyps, or coral-animals, so
  that amidst such surroundings the fishes are quite inconspicuous.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Red Mullets</span> occur chiefly in tropical seas, but one species
  inhabits European waters, and occur sparsely around the British Islands. Occasionally, however,
  these fishes visit the British coasts in vast shoals, more than 5,000 having been taken in a
  single night in August, 1819, in Weymouth Bay, whilst in May, 1851, 10,000 were taken off Yarmouth
  in one week.</p>

  <p>Although about forty species of red mullet are <span class="pagenum" id="page615"><span
  class="smaller">{615}</span></span>known, the European species is the most prized as a food-fish.
  Its fame, indeed, extends backwards to the time of the ancient Romans, who sought far and wide for
  large specimens, paying ruinous prices for them. "Then, as nowadays," writes Dr. G&uuml;nther, "it was
  considered essential for the enjoyment of this delicacy that the fish should exhibit the red
  colour of its integument. The Romans brought it, for that purpose, living into the
  banqueting-room, and allowed it to die in the hands of the guests, the red colour appearing in all
  its brilliancy during the death-struggle of the fish. The fishermen of our times attain the same
  object by scaling the fish immediately after its capture, thus causing a permanent contraction of
  the chromatophores containing the red pigment."</p>

  <p>Beneath the chin of the red mullets will be noticed two long finger-like processes; these can

  shrimps or worms. Even dead food they are said to feel with these barbels, as they are called,
  before biting. The red colour has been observed in the Marine Aquarium at Plymouth to become
  darker when the fish rise from the ground, and to pale away when they descend.</p>

  <p>Two forms of red mullet occur in European waters, but it is not yet finally settled whether
  they represent distinct species. The one is the plain <span class="sc">Red Mullet</span>, of a
  rich carmine-red above and silvery white below; the other the <span class="sc">Striped
  Mullet</span>, or <span class="sc">Sur-mullet</span>, which has a beautiful red colour on the back
  and sides, and from three to five bright yellow bands passing from head to tail. Till recently the
  striped form was regarded as the female of the plain red mullet, but many authorities incline to
  the view that the two are distinct species.</p>

      <p class="sp0">An Australian species of Sea-bream.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Several species of sea-bream occur in Australia, where they are known as <span
  class="sc">Snappers</span>. One of the largest of these, which attains a length of more than 3
  feet and a weight of over 40 lbs., is not only considered excellent eating, but is also the most
  popular sport-yielding fish of that colony.</p>

  <p>The ancient Romans kept a species of sea-bream, the <span class="sc">Gilt-head</span>, in their
  vivariums, where it grew extremely fat. This species is said to stir up the sand with its tail, to
  discover buried shell-fish. It is particularly fond of mussels, and the noise it makes in
  crunching them between its jaws is loud enough to be heard by the fishermen.</p>

  <p>Nearly allied to the Sea-breams are a group known, for want of a better name, as the <span
  class="sc">Thick-rayed Fishes</span>, some of which rank as of prime importance among the
  food-fishes of the British Colonies. A general idea of the shape of the members of this family may
  be gathered from the photograph of an Australian <span class="sc">Groper</span>. The name of <span
  class="sc">Long-fin</span>, given to one species, is bestowed on account of the fact that one or
  more of the rays of the breast-fin on each side is drawn out into a filament, often of very
  considerable length, which is used as an organ of touch. In other species, where the elongation is
  less, and more rays have undergone modification, an auxiliary organ of locomotion is the result.
  At the Cape of Good Hope species of long-fin are very abundant, and preserved in large quantities
  for export.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Other members of this family lack the elongated fin-rays altogether. The fishes
  known as the <span class="sc">Tumpeters</span> of New Zealand and Tasmania belong to this section.
  They are considered by the colonists the best flavoured of any native fishes, and are eaten smoked
  as well as fresh. But two species are known, one ranging from 30 to 60 lbs. in weight, and the
  other, a much smaller form, scarcely attaining a weight of 20 lbs.; the latter is the more
  abundant of the two, though confined to the coast of New Zealand.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the <span class="sc">Scorpion-fishes</span> we have a small group including several forms
  remarkable for their ugliness, having added to an uncouth shape skinny appendages, which,
  projecting from the body, resemble rather leaves of <span class="pagenum" id="page617"><span
  class="smaller">{617}</span></span>seaweed than parts of the fish. These appendages, by their
  waving motion, serve either to attract other fishes or to afford concealment by their resemblance
  to the surrounding weeds. The ground-dwelling forms have some of the rays of the breast-fin
  modified into finger-like processes, like those of the Gurnards, by which they both crawl and
  feel. Some members of the family bear a rather close resemblance to the Sea-perches. In addition
  to their ugliness, some have become especially offensive by the transformation of certain of the
  fin-spines into poison-organs.</p>

  <p>One of the ugliest, and at the same time most dreaded, of the family is the <span
  class="sc">Stone-fish</span> figured on page <a href="#page619">619</a>. Each spine of the back
  fin is grooved. At the lower end of these grooves lies a pear-shaped bag containing a milky
  poison, which is conveyed to the point of the spine by ducts lying in the grooves. The native
  fishermen carefully avoid handling these fish; but persons walking with bare feet in the sea step
  upon the spines, and, receiving the poison into the wound, are killed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>All the scorpion-fish are carnivorous, and differ from the majority of fishes in that they
  produce their young alive. The smallest of the Spiny-finned fishes are members of this group, some
  scarcely exceeding 1&frac12; inch in length. They are common amid the coral-reefs of the Pacific.</p>

  <p>Passing over some comparatively unimportant members of this family, we come to a small group of
  vegetable-feeders from the Indo-Pacific, of which the <span class="sc">Teuthis</span> is one of
  the best known representatives. They are chiefly remarkable for the fact that the abdominal cavity
  is surrounded by a complete ring of bones, and that the air-bladder is forked at both ends. Some
  are rather brilliantly coloured.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Slime-heads</span>, which constitute the next family, derive their name
  from the presence on the head of large mucus-bearing cavities covered with a thin skin. The eyes
  are always of great size, indicating a deep-sea habitat, or at least a depth only dimly lighted.
  All indeed, save two species, descend considerably below the surface, one species having been
  found in 345 fathoms. The species of one genus are believed to inhabit still greater depths, for
  their eyes are extremely small, indicating degeneration through disuse. The copious supply of
  slime is also an indication of a deep-sea habitat. The members of this family vary much in size
  and shape, but the most remarkable of all is a small and rare species <span class="pagenum"
  id="page618"><span class="smaller">{618}</span></span>found off Japan, in which the scales have
  joined together to form a perfectly solid armour, whilst the paired fins of the abdomen have been
  reduced to a single spine, with a few vestiges of other rays.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The next family, a comparatively small one, includes the <span class="sc">Tassel-fish</span>,
  so called from the long and delicate feelers springing from the base of the breast-fins, of which
  they originally formed a part. Varying in number from three to fourteen, these feelers can be
  moved independently of the fins. As these fishes all live in muddy water, and have the eyes
  obscured by films, such tactile organs are necessary, in order to enable them to procure their
  food. In some species they attain an enormous length. The flesh is highly esteemed. Some species
  have an air-bladder, which yields a good kind of isinglass, and forms an article of commerce in
  the East Indies. The majority are small species, but some attain to a length of 4 feet.</p>

  <p>No less important than the preceding group, from an economic point of view, are the <span
  class="sc">Meagres</span>, a family of coast-haunting species of the tropical and sub-tropical
  Atlantic and Indian Oceans, exhibiting a special preference for the mouths of large rivers, into
  which they freely enter. Some, indeed, have become entirely fresh-water species.</p>

  <p>One of the most interesting of the family is the species to which the name of <span
  class="sc">Drum</span> has been given, from the extraordinary noise which it produces&mdash;though
  some other kinds emit similar noises. "These sounds," Dr. G&uuml;nther writes, "can better be expressed
  by the word 'drumming' than any other. They appear to be very frequently heard by persons in
  vessels lying at anchor off the coasts of the United States, where these fishes are very common.
  The precise method by which these sounds are produced is not known. Since they are accompanied by
  a tremulous motion of the vessel, it seems more probable that they are due to the beating of the
  tails of the fish against the bottom of the ship to get rid of the parasites with which that part
  of their body is infested." The drum attains a length of more than 4 feet and a weight of over 100
  lbs.</p>

  <p>Though forming but a single small family, the <span class="sc">Sword-fishes</span> are
  nevertheless to be reckoned amongst the most interesting of living fishes. Attaining a length of
  from 12 to 15 feet, exceeding vigilant, pugnacious, and powerful, they are amongst the most
  formidable of all fishes. They derive their name from the great development of the upper jaw,
  which forms a huge, tapering, sword-like weapon, covered along its under-surface with numerous
  small teeth. They attack, apparently without provocation, whales and other large cetaceans, which
  they invariably succeed in killing by repeated thrusts of the sword. It appears that occasionally
  sword-fishes make a mistake, and, after the fashion of Don Quixote, tilt at windmills, in the
  shape of large vessels, under the impression that they are whales. But this most grave error of
  judgment brings with it a heavy penalty, in that, having no power to make effective backward
  movements, the sword remains fixed, and is eventually broken off in the struggle for freedom.
  Frank Buckland reminds us that in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, is a
  section of the bow of a whaler impaled by one of these swords. That portion of the sword which
  remains is 1 foot long and 5 inches in circumference. "At one single blow," he writes, "the fish
  had plunged his sword through, and completely transfixed 13&frac12; inches of solid timber. The sword had
  of course broken off and prevented a dangerous leak in the ship." In the British Museum is a
  second specimen of a ship's side in which the sword of a sword-fish is fixed.</p>

  <p>Of the family of <span class="sc">Hair-tails</span> perhaps the most important members are the
  <span class="sc">Scabbard-</span> or <span class="sc">Frost-fish</span> and the <span
  class="sc">Snoek</span>. The first is common in the Mediterranean and the warmer parts of the
  Atlantic, extending northwards to the south coast of England, where it occurs at rare intervals.
  It is also known in New Zealand, where it is called the Frost-fish, and furthermore is regarded as
  one of the most delicious fish of the colony, its flesh being fine, tender, and of delicate
  flavour. On this account it is much in demand, but the supply is very uncertain. The conditions of
  capture, indeed, of this fish are unparalleled in the annals of fishing, for it can be taken
  neither with the rod nor the net. The would-be captor has to wait patiently under favourable
  conditions on the seashore for the fish to come <span class="pagenum" id="page621"><span
  class="smaller">{621}</span></span>and cast itself up on the beach. This happens with tolerable
  certainty during the autumn and winter months, when the sea is calm and the nights frosty. Then
  the frost-fish come ashore alive, wriggling through the surf on to the beach. Two explanations
  have been offered for this extraordinary conduct. One is that the fish commits suicide; being
  pursued by a shark or other enemy, it prefers uncertain life on land to certain death at sea! The
  other and more probable hypothesis has it that the air-bladder of the fish becomes distended to
  enable it to reach the surface for food&mdash;for it is a deep-sea fish&mdash;and that the keen,
  frosty air prevents it from compressing the bladder and returning to the depths; thus it gradually
  drifts into shallow water, is hurled shorewards by the surf, and finally wriggles itself on to the
  beach to die. The long stretches of sandy beach a few miles from Dunedin are a favourite resort
  for frost-fish catching. Two or three men camp out at the foot of the cliffs overhanging the
  beach, pitching a tent and lighting a huge fire, so as to render life bearable during the long
  vigils. The "fishing" consists in perambulating the beach up and down shortly before dawn, and
  keeping a sharp look-out in the surf for the silver streak which betokens the approach of a
  victim. As soon as a fish is descried, all that remains to be done is to seize hold of it and drag
  it ashore, if it has not already stranded itself, and then dispatch it.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Horse-mackerels</span>, or <span class="sc">Scads</span>, are represented
  by some very bizarre-looking forms. It is a large family, belonging to tropical and temperate
  seas. One species, the <span class="sc">Common Horse mackerel</span>, is common in British seas.
  Many members of the family have the hinder portion of the body on each side armed with large
  plates, well seen in the accompanying photographs; others have the median fins produced into long
  filamentous processes. All are eatable, and some highly esteemed as food. One of the most
  remarkable is the <span class="sc">Pilot-fish</span> of tropical and temperate seas, occurring
  occasionally off the British coasts. It derives its name from its habit of accompanying ships and
  large sharks. From this habit of accompanying ships it was regarded by the ancients as a sacred
  fish, since they considered it pointed out the way to embarrassed sailors, and announced the
  vicinity of land by suddenly disappearing. The close companionship between the pilot-fish and the
  shark has excited much comment, many observers believing that the former was of great use to the
  latter in guiding it to its food. How this is done is graphically described by Dr. Meyer, who
  writes: "The pilot swims constantly in front of the shark; we ourselves have seen three instances
  in which the shark was led by the pilot. When the shark neared the ship, the pilot swam close to
  the snout or near one of the pectoral fins of the animal. Sometimes he darted rapidly forwards or
  sidewards, as if looking for something, and constantly went back again to the shark. When we threw
  overboard a piece of bacon fastened on a great hook, the shark was about twenty paces from the
  ship; with the quickness of lightning the pilot came up, smelt at the dainty, and instantly swam
  back again to the shark, swimming many times round his snout and splashing, as if to give him
  exact information as to the bacon. The shark now began to put himself in motion, the pilot showing
  him the way, and in a moment he was fast upon the hook." As Dr. G&uuml;nther remarks, commenting on
  this account, one may entertain reasonable doubts as to the usefulness of the pilot to the shark
  in this instance! It is probable that the pilots follow the sharks for the sake of feeding on
  fragments scattered by the latter, and also for the sake of picking off the parasites with which
  sharks, in common with other large fish, are infested; furthermore, the pilot, being but a small
  fish, obtains greater security from enemies when in the company of its giant friend. The habit of
  seeking the company of more powerful or otherwise offensive animals is apparent also in other
  members of this family, the <span class="pagenum" id="page623"><span
  class="smaller">{623}</span></span>young of the horse-mackerel seeking shelter beneath the
  "umbrella" of a jelly-fish till they are big enough to defend themselves.</p>

  <p>But the most remarkable members of this family are the <span class="sc">Sea-bats</span>. Few in
  species and confined to the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Western Pacific, they are nevertheless in
  those regions very common. Although not used as food-fishes, they are of extreme interest on
  account of their shape, which is nearly oval and much compressed from side to side, and the form
  of their fins, which in some species are excessively developed. Young sea-bats differ markedly
  from the adults in the much greater length of the fin-rays, so much so that they have frequently
  been described as distinct species.</p>

      <p>LONG-FINNED DORY.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;" class="sp0"> This species closely resembles a fossil form. It
      has nothing to do with the True Dories, but is one of the Coral-fishes, and is placed here for
      the sake of contrast.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>We pass now to the <span class="sc">Dories</span>, which recall the Sea-bats in the oval and
  compressed form of the body. The resemblance to sea-bats is, indeed, so close that the latter are
  frequently described as dories. The mouth of the members of this family is so constructed that,
  when opened, the upper jaw is thrust forward, and the whole mouth forms a kind of long tube.
  Dories inhabit the seas of the temperate regions, two species being fairly common in British
  waters. The best known of these two is perhaps the John Dory, the largest specimens of which
  attain to a weight of 18 lbs. Mr. Cunningham has described the very peculiar way in which the dory
  captures its prey. "It does not," he writes, "overtake it by superior speed like the mackerel, or
  lie in wait for it like the angler, but stalks it and approaches it by stealth. It is able to do
  this in consequence of the extreme thinness of its body and the peculiar movement of its hinder
  dorsal and ventral fins. The dory places itself end on towards the fish it desires to devour, and
  in this position it is evident that it excites no alarm on the part of its prey. The appearance of
  the dory, seen in this way, is a mere line in the water, to which no particular significance can
  be attached. I have not particularly noticed the effect of the ribbons of membrane which project
  from the dorsal fin. But I have observed that the movements of the dory are very gradual, except
  in turning; it alters the position of its body by a turn of the tail or side-fins, and then swims
  forward by vibrating the second dorsal <span class="pagenum" id="page624"><span
  class="smaller">{624}</span></span>and ventral, a movement which causes very slight disturbance of
  the water. The appearance of the dory in these actions is suggestive of suppressed excitement, his
  eyes being fixed on his prey. I do not recollect seeing him actually swallow another fish, but
  have no doubt that he gets near enough to a sprat, for example, without alarming it, to seize it
  by the sudden elongation of his curious jaws." The way in which these jaws are elongated is
  admirably shown in the photograph on page <a href="#page622">622</a>.</p>

  <p>Passing now to the Mackerel Family, we arrive at a group of considerable importance from an
  economic point of view. Extremely active, migrating, and predaceous, mackerel swim in shoals and
  seize their prey with great voracity, hunting merely by sight, and snapping at anything moving
  through the water, especially if it is silvery, like a small surface-fish. The various species
  differ greatly in size, ranging from the Common Mackerel of about 18 inches long to the giant
  Tunny weighing nearly half a ton.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Common Mackerel</span> swim in vast shoals, or "schools," as they are called,
  and one half a mile wide and at least twenty miles long is on record. Mackerel feed on the young
  of other fish and small fish generally, and, when these are not to be had, on minute crabs and
  shrimps. They are very prolific, a single mackerel laying from 430,000 to 540,000 eggs.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Tunnies</span> are amongst the largest of the surface-fishes of the ocean.
  Abundant in the Mediterranean Sea, they occur occasionally in British waters. For centuries the
  flesh of the tunny has been held in high regard as food, and it is frequently seen in the Lisbon
  markets at the present day. The flesh, which is as red as beef, is cut up and sold by weight. The
  <span class="sc">Bonito</span> closely resembles the tunny, but is a much smaller fish, which
  preys largely upon flying-fishes, which it follows for long distances.</p>

  <p>Peculiarly interesting are the <span class="sc">Sucking-fishes</span>. The name by which they
  are commonly known is bestowed on account of the presence of a large oval sucker, placed on the
  top of the head and extending backwards over the shoulders&mdash;an organ formed by modification
  of the back-fin. By means of this sucking-disk these fishes are enabled to attach themselves to
  sharks, turtles, ships, or any large object floating in the sea. The hold which they obtain is so
  strong that it is almost impossible to remove them by force. Being poor swimmers, this method of
  transportation enables them to pass rapidly to fresh feeding-grounds.</p>

  <p>The natives of Zanzibar, Cuba, and Torres Straits are said to employ sucking-fishes in the
  capture of sleeping turtles, the fish being secured by a ring round the tail, and liberated as
  soon as a sufficiently near approach to the quarry has been made. About ten different species are
  known, the bulkiest of which attains a length of 2 feet and a weight of about 8 lbs., a longer but
  more slender species measuring 3 feet.</p>

  <p>Carnivorous, of small size, and feeble swimming-powers, the family of the <span
  class="sc">Weavers</span> are remarkable rather for their disagreeable qualities than anything
  else, though at least one <span class="pagenum" id="page625"><span
  class="smaller">{625}</span></span>species is declared to be excellent eating. The <span
  class="sc">Star-gazer</span> is a particularly ugly-looking fish, especially noteworthy in that
  the eyes, which are on the top of the head, can be raised and depressed at pleasure, whilst the
  heavy jaw is armed with a freely moving tentacle, which, waving about in the current of water
  drawn in at the mouth, serves as a lure to attract small fishes, the rest of the body being
  concealed between stones at the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Common Weaver</span> is a well-known British fish, much dreaded on account
  of the poisonous wounds which it inflicts unless most carefully handled, the poison being
  introduced by the spines of the back-fin and gill-cover. No special poison-organs seem to be
  developed, but the mucous secretion around the spines has poisonous properties. As the flesh of
  this fish is extremely palatable, fishermen remove the spines at once directly after capture.
  Should a wound be inflicted, great suffering and occasionally death follows.</p>

  <p>Passing over one or two unimportant groups, we come to the family of the <span
  class="sc">Frog-fishes</span>, which, but for the fact that many of its members are poisonous,
  calls for no special comment here. One species, however, from the coasts of Central America,
  possesses the distinction of having the most highly developed poison-organs of any fishes, being
  equalled only by the <span class="pagenum" id="page626"><span
  class="smaller">{626}</span></span>Venomous Snakes. The poison-weapons are a spine on the
  gill-cover and two spines of the back-fin. The former is of the same shape as the hollow
  venom-fang of a snake, perforated at both ends. A little bag containing the poison lies at the
  base of the spine, and when pressed by the spine as it makes its puncture ejects its contents into
  the body of the latter, whence it escapes from the hole in the top. The structure of the
  back-spines is similar.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The family of the <span class="sc">Angler-fishes</span> contain more strange forms than any
  other. Living on the sea-bottom and seeking their prey by stealth, angler-fishes do not need
  powerful swimming-muscles; consequently the size of the body and tail has become considerably
  reduced, so that the head, relatively to the rest of the body, is unusually large. The head, jaws,
  and belly are indeed of great size and capacity. The side or paired fins are not used for
  swimming, but have become modified to serve as feet, enabling the fish to shuffle along the
  ground. A further remarkable feature of these fishes is seen in the back-fin, the rays of which
  are very long, the foremost being provided with a flag-like flap of skin at the top, extremely
  sensitive to touch, and playing a very important part in the capture of food. It seems that the
  fish commonly lies concealed on the sea-bottom, with this "flag" erected. From its general
  resemblance to the surrounding seaweed it is quite inconspicuous, so that passing fishes take no
  trouble to avoid it. If by any chance they should touch it, however, the jaws beneath open
  instantly, and the unfortunate trespasser is suddenly engulfed. This elaborate and sensitive
  mechanism has been likened to a spring-trap, which is always set, and never betrays its presence.
  It seems probable, however, that this flag serves also as a lure, passing fishes being
  occasionally attracted by the waving flap of skin. Should they become sufficiently curious as to
  proceed to touch it, capture in the manner above described is certain. Certain deep-sea forms have
  a luminous organ in the place of the flap of skin, and this certainly seems to act only as a
  lure.</p>

  <p>Angler-fishes are found all over the world; some, as we have seen, are bottom-fishes, some
  inhabit deep sea, whilst others lie hidden amongst floating seaweed, to which they cling by <span
  class="pagenum" id="page627"><span class="smaller">{627}</span></span>means of their arm-like
  fins. Only one species occurs in British waters. Its method of spawning is remarkable, in that the
  eggs are laid in the form of large raft-like sheets, which float on the surface of the sea. The
  number of eggs laid by a single fish has been computed to be 1,345,000. A single sheet of spawn
  may measure from 2 to 3 feet in breadth and from 25 to 30 feet long.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Bull-heads</span> and <span class="sc">Gurnards</span>, constituting the
  next family, are characterised by the spiny armature of the head and the great size of the
  breast-fins. The former are represented in British waters by four species, one of which, the <span

  fully armed with spines, which are highly poisonous, and cause a violent irritation. These fishes
  live in shallow water, lying on the bottom, with which their colours harmonise so completely that
  they are practically invisible. The very large ventral fins&mdash;those seen in the photograph
  immediately behind the breast-fins&mdash;are of great use in locomotion.</p>

  tropical to arctic seas. Their curiously shaped heads give them a very quaint appearance. One of
  the most remarkable peculiarities of these fishes is the separate condition of some of the rays of
  the breast-fins, which form finger-like organs, used to feel the ground and rake over loose
  stones, to discover small shrimps and other animals hidden underneath. Furthermore, the gurnards
  are peculiar in that they are enabled to communicate one with another by means of sounds produced
  by the expulsion of air from one compartment of the air-bladder to another. The females are much
  more common than the males, and also slightly larger. The young are remarkable for the enormous
  size of the breast-fins, though even in the adult these are unusually large.</p>

  <p>Ugly in appearance and carnivorous in habits, the Sucker-fish Family are distinguished by the
  presence of a large round sucker on the belly, with which they adhere to rocks. Furthermore, the
  sucker-fishes are remarkable for the softness of their skeleton, which may be cut through at any
  point with an ordinary knife. The male lump-sucker is smaller than the female, but much more
  brightly coloured, especially during the breeding-season, when he dons a livery of blue, scarlet,
  and yellow. He is also a model parent, always remaining near the eggs and keeping a constant
  stream of fresh water running over them by the action of his breast-fins. A single female may
  produce as many as 136,000 eggs in a single season. In Scotland the male is known as the <span
  class="sc">Cock</span> and the female as the <span class="sc">Hen Paddle</span>. The species is
  more common off the coasts of Scotland than elsewhere in the British Islands.</p>

  <p>Like the Lump-suckers, the <span class="sc">Gobies</span>, which form the next family, have the
  ventral fins modified so as to form a sucking-disk, which is used as an anchor. But the gobies are
  easily <span class="pagenum" id="page629"><span class="smaller">{629}</span></span>distinguished
  by their smaller size, elongated bodies, hard skeleton, and the disposition and structure of the
  fins, characters which need not be discussed further.</p>

  <p>One species, the <span class="sc">Spotted Goby</span>, or <span class="sc">Pole-wing</span>,
  found in the Thames, is noteworthy on account of its nest-building habits. The male chooses the
  empty shell of a cockle or mussel, selecting one with its concave surface downwards. Beneath this
  the sand is cleared away and cemented by a special glue-like secretion formed by the skin of the
  fish. A cylindrical tunnel is then built to give access to the nest, and the whole is covered over
  with loose stones. In the nest-chamber formed by the shell the eggs are laid, the male immediately
  after mounting guard over them till they hatch, which they do in about nine days.</p>

  <p>Another species, the <span class="sc">Pellucid Goby</span>, is remarkable in that its whole
  life's course is run in a single year. In June and July the eggs are laid; they are hatched in
  August; by the time winter has arrived the fish have reached maturity, and die off in the
  following July and August, so that in September only the fry are to be met with.</p>

  <p>One of the strangest of all fishes is a member of the Goby Family. This is the <span
  class="sc">Walking-fish</span>, so called from its habit of spending most of its time on the
  mud-banks of rivers, or on the roots of trees growing in the neighbourhood. The late
  Surgeon-General Day, describing these fishes as he saw them along the side of the Burmese rivers,
  writes that at first sight they look like large tadpoles. When suddenly startled by something,
  away they go with a hop, skip, and a jump inland among the trees, or on the water like a flat
  stone or piece of slate sent skimming by a schoolboy. When climbing, the breast-fins are used, as
  if they were arms, to grasp the boughs. If placed in deep water, these fishes are speedily
  drowned!</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page630"><span class="smaller">{630}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Blennies</span> are fishes whose skins are soft, slimy, and quite
  scaleless, or at most covered with very tiny and degenerate scales. The general form of the body
  may be seen in the photograph below. They are shore-fishes, lurking about in the crevices of
  rocks, among seaweed, or under stones, and occurring generally along the coasts of temperate and
  tropical regions. The species known as the <span class="sc">Sea-cat</span> or <span
  class="sc">Wolf-fish</span> is, however, a deep-water form.</p>

  <p>As a rule the eggs are deposited in hollow places between stones or rocks; but in the <span
  class="sc">Butter-fish</span>, or <span class="sc">Gunnel</span>, the eggs are adhesive, and the
  parents roll them into a ball by coiling their bodies round them. Furthermore, since the parents
  are frequently found, under natural conditions, coiled round these masses of spawn, it appears
  that they adopt this method of guarding their treasures. Some species bring forth their young
  alive.</p>

  <p>The largest of the family is the <span class="sc">Wolf-fish</span>, whose jaws are armed with
  very powerful teeth, able to crush the hardest shells, such as those of the whelk. Sea-urchins and
  crabs are also eaten.</p>

  <p>We pass on to a group comprising three families&mdash;the <span class="sc">Barracudas</span>,
  <span class="sc">Sand-smelts</span>, and <span class="sc">Grey Mullets</span>.</p>

  <p>It should be mentioned that two very distinct fishes are known as <span
  class="sc">Barracudas</span>, one of which we have already described under the name of Snoek. The
  forms described here as barracudas are large, voracious fishes living in tropical and sub-tropical
  seas, and evincing a preference for the coast rather than the open sea. Attaining a length of 8
  feet and a weight of 40 lbs., they are a source of danger to bathers. They are very frequently
  used as food, though in the West Indies such food is attended with some danger, as the flesh is
  often poisonous, from the fish having fed on smaller poisonous fishes.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sand-smelts</span> are small carnivorous species inhabiting the seas of
  temperate and tropical regions. Many enter fresh-water, and some have become entirely acclimatised
  there. Some species bear a very close resemblance to the true smelt, from which, however, they may
  be readily distinguished by their small, spinous, first back-fin. The young of at least one small
  group or genus of this family are remarkable for their habit of clinging together for some time
  after they are hatched in dense masses and almost incredible numbers.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Grey Mullets</span> are brackish-water fishes, feeding on vegetable
  growths and minute shell-fish. They also suck up large quantities of sand into the mouth for the
  sake of the minute organisms contained therein; much of this is passed on into the stomach, which
  is thick and muscular, like that of many birds. Altogether some seventy species of grey mullets

  <p>The <span class="sc">Flute-mouths</span>, <span class="sc">Sticklebacks</span>, and <span

  They are shore-fishes, entering brackish water, and confined to sub-tropical and tropical parts of
  the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific.</p>

  <p>Of the <span class="sc">Sticklebacks</span> there are several species, some of which are
  entirely salt-water fishes, whilst others enjoy the rather unusual distinction of being able to
  live in either fresh or salt water, even when rapidly transferred from one to the other. The small
  species commonly inhabiting ponds and ditches can sustain changes of this kind with impunity.
  These last are very ferocious. One kept in an aquarium devoured in five hours seventy-four young
  dace about a quarter of an inch long. They occasionally occur in vast shoals, and, according to
  the naturalist Pennant, appear in the river Welland, in Lincolnshire, once in seven years in
  amazing shoals, so that a man employed in collecting them earned four shillings a day by selling
  them at the rate of a halfpenny a bushel!</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Tortoise-fishes</span> may serve as the representatives of the last family
  of this group. They are very remarkable fishes, being invested in a wonderful bony cuirass, formed
  by a modification of the skeleton, similar to what has taken place among the Tortoises and
  Turtles. The body is so thin that it looks as if it had been artificially compressed, and is
  semi-transparent. Three species are known from the tropical Indo-Pacific and three from other
  seas; besides these are four smaller and less perfectly armed forms, one of which, the <span
  class="sc">Trumpet-fish</span>, or <span class="sc">Bellows-fish</span>, occurs rarely off the
  south coast of England.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">The Garpike</span> and <span class="sc">Flying-fishes</span> are both
  interesting, especially the latter. The garpike is represented by several species, easily
  recognised by the long, pointed jaws. These fishes are furthermore peculiar in that the bones are
  green, a colour which remains even after cooking, and on this account some object to eating them,
  supposing the unusual colour to indicate unsoundness. The elongated jaws are not developed in the
  young fish, and, strangely enough, as this character is acquired, the lower jaw grows faster than
  the upper. In some species the lower jaw remains permanently the longer; hence they are known as
  <span class="sc">Half-beaks</span>.</p>

  Flying-gurnards already <span class="pagenum" id="page633"><span

  breast-fins, to take extended journeys through the air. The flight of these fishes is, however,
  not quite the same as true flight, inasmuch as the fins serve mainly as a parachute, and do not,
  by sustained vigorous movements, propel the body through the air, like the wings of bats and
  birds. Darting out of the water when pursued by an enemy or frightened by a passing vessel, these
  fish are borne along by the wind, the speed at first being very considerable, exceeding indeed
  that of a ship going ten miles an hour. At a single flight they may cover as much as 500 feet, but
  are quite unable to steer themselves, except when, during their course, the tail-fin is immersed
  in the water, when by a stroke from one side to the other the direction may be changed from left
  to right, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, as the case may be. By day they will avoid ships, but by night,
  when they are unable to see, "they frequently fly," writes Dr. G&uuml;nther, "against the
  weather-board, where they are caught by the current of air and carried upwards to a height of 20
  feet above the surface of the water, while under ordinary circumstances they keep close to
  it."</p>

  <p>The members of the four families noticed in this chapter are remarkable for their wonderful
  coloration. The species of the first family, from their peculiarly striking resemblance to the
  Scaly-finned group, share with them the name of <span class="sc">Coral-fishes</span>. This
  resemblance is a very remarkable one. Occurring, like the Scaly-fins, more abundantly in the
  neighbourhood of coral-reefs, they also resemble the latter not only in shape, but also in
  coloration, the same pattern being often common to members of both families.</p>

  <p>To this family belongs the remarkable fish known as the <span class="sc">Amphiprion</span>,
  which makes its home in the interior of an enormous species of sea-anemone measuring 2 feet
  across. When first discovered by Mr. Saville-Kent, it was believed that the fish had been
  swallowed&mdash;a view, however, which was speedily rejected, when it was found that, if ejected
  by means of a stick, it invariably returned. Thus the anemone is obviously to be regarded as host,
  and not as captor. More than this, from the facts so far to hand, it appears that this strangely
  assorted pair are mutually dependent on one another, at least to a large extent&mdash;the fish
  undertaking to supply the larder, whilst the anemone in return affords shelter from enemies. The
  part played by each is as follows:&mdash;The fish, which is very conspicuous, wearing a livery of
  vermilion crossed by three bands of white, sallies forth and swims about till it attracts the
  attention of some other carnivorous member of its class, on which, if it gives chase, the
  amphiprion returns with all speed to its living cave, and quickly disappears down its mouth. The
  pursuer, blundering against the outspread tentacles, is immediately paralysed by a shower <span
  class="pagenum" id="page634"><span class="smaller">{634}</span></span>of stinging-darts which
  proceed therefrom as a result of the shock, and, rendered insensible, becomes the spoil of both.
  Thus the active fish plays the part of a lure, and in return is afforded shelter.</p>

      Lip-fishes.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Wrasses</span> proper may be distinguished, amongst other things, by their
  thickened lips&mdash;hence the name Lip-fishes given them by German naturalists&mdash;by the
  greatly extended back-fin, the greater part of which is spinous, and the arrangement of the teeth,
  which need not be discussed here. They are shore-fishes, living in the neighbourhood of
  weed-covered rocks, or in tropical seas, where they are most abundant, amid coral-reefs. Most are
  brilliantly, many gaudily coloured, iridescent hues frequently adding to the beauty formed by the
  permanent deposit of coloured pigments in the scales. Some grow to a large size, specimens not
  seldom exceeding a weight of 50 lbs., and these are the most esteemed as food-fishes, the smaller
  species, as a rule, being regarded as of inferior quality.</p>

  <p>A well-known British species is the <span class="sc">Striped</span> or <span class="sc">Red
  Wrasse</span>, the sexes of which exhibit a remarkable variation in colour, the male having the
  body marked with blue streaks or a blackish band, whilst the female has two or three large black
  blotches across the tail. A second British species, the <span class="sc">Ballan Wrasse</span>, is
  bluish green in colour, with the scales and fin-rays reddish orange. It may be found hiding in the
  deep gullies among rocks, sheltering in the dense clusters of seaweed, and feeding on crabs and
  shrimps. It takes a bait freely, and fishermen have remarked that at first they catch few but
  large fish; some days later a great number may be caught, but all will be of small size,
  indicating that the larger fish assume the dominion of a district and keep the smaller at bay.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The Parrot-fishes, or Parrot-wrasses, are so called on account of the peculiar
      structure of the teeth in the front of the jaws, which form a sharp-edged beak.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Amongst the most brilliantly coloured of the wrasses are the <span
  class="sc">Parrot-fish</span>. Mr. Saville-Kent, writing of the species which inhabit the waters
  of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, remarks that to stand up to your knees or higher in water,
  with such a shoal of magnificent fishes swimming round you, is an experience well worth a journey
  to the tropics. The coloration of these fishes, which is extremely transient, fading almost
  immediately after death, nearly defies description. One of the most beautiful is perhaps the <span
  class="sc">Gold-finned Coral-fish</span>, in which the body is of an intense ultramarine, whilst
  the fins are bright golden. Others have the most amazing combinations of green, vermilion, blue,
  and yellow, in endless variety. It was one of the parrot-fishes which found such favour with the
  ancients. "In the time of Pliny," writes Dr. G&uuml;nther, "it was considered to be the first of fishes
  ... and the <span class="pagenum" id="page635"><span class="smaller">{635}</span></span>expense
  incurred by Elipentius was justified, in the opinion of the Roman gourmands, by the extreme
  delicacy of the flesh. It was a fish, said the poet, whose very excrement the gods themselves were
  unwilling to reject. Its flesh was tender, agreeable, sweet, easy of digestion, and quickly
  assimilated; yet, if it happened to have eaten an aplysia, it produced violent diarrh&#x0153;a."
  To this day the Greeks hold it in high regard, and eat it with sauce made of its liver and
  intestines. It feeds on seaweed, and from its habit of thoroughly chewing its food, and moving it
  backwards and forwards in the mouth, it was at one time believed that this fish chewed the cud
  after the fashion of the ruminating mammals!</p>

  <p>One of the most interesting of all the wrasses is a small species from King George's Sound,
  which, while retaining the principal characters common to the group, has assumed the general shape
  and proportions of the pipe-fish.</p>

  <p>The third family of the wrasses are remarkable chiefly on account of the fact that they produce
  their young alive. These fishes are confined to the temperate regions of the North Pacific.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Chromids</span> constitute the last family of the wrasse-like group.
  Numerous in species, they are all dwellers in fresh-water. One species occurs in amazing numbers
  in the Lake of Galilee, shoals over an acre in extent, and so closely packed that movement seemed
  almost impossible, having been recorded. They are taken in such enormous numbers that the nets in
  which they are caught often break. Occasionally shoals are carried down the Jordan into the Dead
  Sea; but the fish never get farther than a few yards, becoming stupefied almost at once, and,
  turning over on their backs, fall an easy prey to flocks of cormorants and kingfishers. Heaps of
  putrefying carcases are washed ashore, poisoning the atmosphere, in spite of the presence of
  flocks of ravens and vultures which have gathered to the feast.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Another species is remarkable for its peculiar method of protecting the eggs and
  young. The female deposits the eggs, over 200 in number, in a small hole worked out among the
  roots of reeds and rushes. There they are taken into the mouth of the male one by one, and
  retained till hatched a few days later. The young fry remain in this nursery for some considerable
  time, increasing rapidly in size, so that the father-nurse is unable to close his mouth. Some of
  the young develop among the gills; others lie, closely packed, with their heads turned towards the
  mouth of the parent, remaining in this position till nearly 4 inches long, when they are ejected
  or wriggle out to forage for themselves.</p>

      <p class="sp0">From the formidable armature of spines, known also as the Sea-hedgehog.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Tuft-gilled Fishes</span> are represented by two families&mdash;the <span
  class="sc">Mailed Tube-mouths</span> and the <span class="sc">Pipe-fishes</span> and <span
  class="sc">Sea-horses</span>, all of which have undergone very considerable modification of form,
  the body being encased in mail-like armour, whilst the jaws are toothless and produced into a long
  tube.</p>

  <p>The first family is composed of a few small fishes from the Indian Ocean. Grotesque in
  appearance, they are remarkable also for the fact that the female takes sole charge not only of
  the eggs, which are exceedingly minute, but the young fry also. Only one other fish is known in
  which the care of the eggs and young is undertaken by the female: this is one of the Cat-fishes,
  described in a later chapter. The eggs in the <span class="sc">Tube-mouths</span> are carried in a
  pouch formed by the union of the inner borders of the ventral fins, which are long and broad. For
  the retention of the eggs within the pouch its wall develops long filaments, which serve the
  purpose of slender fingers.</p>

  <p>The second of these families contains the <span class="sc">Pipe-fishes</span> and <span
  class="sc">Sea-horses</span>. They are small marine fishes, inhabiting the seas of tropical and
  temperate regions wherever there is sufficient vegetation to offer shelter, for they are
  peculiarly defenceless creatures. They possess but feeble powers of swimming, and consequently are
  not seldom borne away by strong currents far out to sea or on to distant shores. Their method of
  locomotion is, indeed, quite different from that of other fishes, as they progress neither by
  undulatory motions of the body nor by powerful strokes of the tail, but by wriggling in the case
  of the pipe-fishes, or vibrating motions of the back-fin in the sea-horses.</p>

  <p>The long, semi-cylindrical <span class="sc">Pipe-fishes</span>, partly on account of their
  peculiar form and colour, and partly on account of their swaying motions, so closely resemble the
  fronds of seaweed <span class="pagenum" id="page637"><span
  class="smaller">{637}</span></span>amongst which they dwell as to pass unnoticed by their enemies.
  Unlike the Tube-mouths, just described, the care of the eggs and young devolves upon the males.
  The young are borne in a pouch, but, ventral fins being wanting, this is formed by a fold of skin
  developed from each side of the trunk and tail, the free margins being united in the middle line.
  Here the eggs remain till they are hatched. But the pouch is by no means done with after this
  event, for the young continue to occupy it for some time, returning when danger threatens&mdash;a
  habit which recalls the custom of the young of the kangaroo. Mr. Yarrell relates a curious fact
  which he gleaned from some fishermen&mdash;to wit, that if they take a pipe-fish, open the pouch,
  and drop the young into the sea, they will not disperse, but hover around the spot, as if waiting
  for their parent. Then, if the newly opened fish be held in the water, the young immediately
  return and enter the pouch. In another species of pipe-fish the eggs, instead of being carried in
  a pouch, are held by a sticky secretion to a groove in the under surface of the parent. This
  groove would seem to indicate the beginning from which the complete pouch has been developed. The
  pipe-fishes swim in a very peculiar manner, holding the body now in a vertical, and now in a
  horizontal position, accompanied by contortions of every conceivable kind, poking their long
  snouts into bunches of seaweed in search of food as they go.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sea-horses</span> have a still more eccentrically modified form, inasmuch
  as the body is thrown into a series of curves, the head being bent upon the trunk in a manner
  suggestive of the head and neck of the horse; hence the name of the group. The tail, which lacks
  the membranous portion, or fin, can be spirally coiled, and is used as an organ of prehension, and
  on this account is unique amongst fishes. Gripping the stems of seaweeds with this tail, and
  swaying the body to and fro among the vegetation, the fish is rendered comparatively
  inconspicuous, the lines of the body being broken up by numerous more or less filamentous
  processes, which in one species, the <span class="sc">Fucus-like Sea-horse</span>, become
  excessively developed, forming long, frond-like blades. These, streaming in the water, both by
  their shape and coloration render the resemblance to the vegetable growths in which the animal
  hides so perfect that detection is almost impossible. Thus they furnish one of the most remarkable
  examples of adaptation to the environment amongst living animals. The males of most sea-horses,

  mentioned the eggs are embedded in the soft skin on the under surface of the tail.</p>

  <p>Sea-horses swim with the body more or less vertical, the motive power being supplied by rapid
  vibration of the back-fin. Both pipe-fishes and sea-horses occur in British seas, the first being
  the more common.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Comb-gilled Fishes</span>, to which we come next, are divided into two
  families, whose members are as remarkable for their extraordinary shape as are the tuft-gilled
  forms just discussed. The abnormal shapes which mark out certain fishes so conspicuously from the
  more normal and typical forms are generally regarded as adaptations, serving to ensure
  concealment, to ward off attack, or to effect the capture of prey otherwise unattainable.
  Instances illustrating all three of these ends are furnished by these two groups of the tuft- and
  comb-gilled fishes.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">File-fishes</span> and <span class="sc">Coffer-fishes</span>, which form
  the first of the two families, present considerable variation in shape as well as in the covering
  of the body, which may be naked, covered with rough scales or bony spines, or invested in a
  complete bony cuirass.</p>

  <p>The file-fishes are represented by numerous species, the typical one being known also as the
  <span class="sc">Trigger-fish</span>, on account of an armature of spines on the top of the back.
  These spines are three in number; the first is very strong, roughened like a file&mdash;hence the
  name File-fish&mdash;and hollowed out behind to receive the second much smaller spine, which has a
  projection in front at its base, fitting into a notch in the first. Thus these two spines can only
  be raised or depressed simultaneously, and the first cannot be forced down unless the second has
  been previously depressed. These fishes have very powerful teeth, to break off pieces of coral,
  which form a large part of their diet. They also destroy a large number of shell-fish, and work
  great destruction amongst pearl-oysters. Frequently these fishes, when eaten, prove highly
  poisonous, from having fed on poisonous corals, jelly-fish, or decomposing substances.</p>

      <p>SEA-HORSES.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;" class="sp0"> The species on the right is remarkable for the
      development of long leaf-like processes all over the body, causing the fish to bear a very
      close resemblance to the seaweed amongst which it dwells.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Coffer-fishes</span> derive their name from the box-like cuirass in which
  they are invested. This is formed by numerous closely fitting, hexagonal bony plates, forming a
  mosaic, and leaving only the fins and hind part of the tail free. This bony case varies greatly in
  form, in some species being three-ridged, in others four- or even five-ridged; while in some long
  horns are developed, making the defensive armature still more complex. More than twenty species
  are known, all confined to tropical and sub-tropical seas.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Globe-fishes</span> and <span class="sc">Sun-fishes</span> constitute the
  last family of this really extraordinary assemblage. The covering of the body consists either of
  minute scales or large spines, which can frequently be raised or depressed at will. All the
  members inhabit tropical or sub-tropical seas, and a few occur in the fresh-waters of the same
  regions.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Globe-fishes</span> have short, thick bodies, covered either with small
  spines, as in the <span class="sc">Toad-fish</span>, or very large ones, as in the <span
  class="sc">Porcupine-fish</span>, or <span class="sc">Sea-hedgehog</span>. They are remarkable for
  their habit of filling the gullet with air, and then distending the body to an enormous size. This
  device enables the fish to escape its enemies; for when so inflated it rises to the surface and
  floats belly-upwards, and, the inflated portion projecting above the water, the fish is blown
  along by the wind to more secure regions. The more heavily armed species become still more
  formidable when inflated, as the spines are then fully erected. Escaping from enemies below by
  flight, they are thus secure from enemies above by reason of their armature. Globe-fishes have
  been found floating alive and unhurt within the stomachs of sharks which had swallowed them, and
  one has even been known to eat its way out through its captor's side, and so killing its would-be
  devourer! When a globe-fish desires to return to its normal elongated shape, it expels the air
  from the gullet through the mouth and gills, the expulsion causing a curious hissing sound.</p>

  <p>Extremely unlike the foregoing members of the group of comb-gilled fishes, the <span
  class="sc">Sun-fish</span> is nevertheless quite as remarkable in form, looking as if it had
  undergone the amputation of its hind parts. The singular shape of the other members of the comb-
  and tuft-gilled fishes are undoubtedly adaptations to avoid enemies, either by rendering the
  animal inconspicuous, or hurtful by reason of its powerful armature. The form of the sun-fish
  appears to be an adaptation for the capture of food, as this fish preys largely upon the fry of
  other fishes which inhabit enormous depths, and consequently can only be obtained by diving.
  Sun-fishes inhabit the surface-waters, but as divers have few equals.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>THE COD FAMILY.</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">BY JOHN BICKERDYKE, M.A.</span></p>

  <p>The large and important Cod Family belongs to the order of Spineless Fishes and the group in
  which both sides of the head are symmetrical. The Common Cod, the Whiting, the Haddock, the
  Pollack, the Coal-fish, the Hake, the Ling, and the little Rocklings, all belong to this important
  family, which has one representative in fresh-water, the Burbot, or Eel-pout, found in various
  rivers in Central and Northern Europe and North America.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most remarkable member of the Cod Family is the <span class="sc">Chiasmodus</span>,
  which has huge jaws lined with large pointed teeth, and a distensible stomach and abdomen. During
  the <i>Challenger</i> Expedition a specimen was taken 1,500 fathoms down in the North Atlantic. It
  had swallowed another fish, a kind of scopelus, more than twice its own size. The stomach of the
  chiasmodus had swelled to an enormous extent, and had become so thin from distension that the fish
  inside could be clearly seen through its walls. The scopelus, it is interesting to mention, is a
  fish brought up sometimes by the dredge from 2,500 fathoms. It occasionally comes to the surface
  at night, and has phosphorescent spots along its sides, giving out a dim light, which has its uses
  in the dark depths of the sea.</p>

  <p>To come back to the head of the family, the <span class="sc">Cod</span> is a fairly plentiful
  fish all around the British and Irish coasts, but appears to be decreasing in some waters as time
  goes on, owing to the over-trawling of the North Sea. Off the coasts of Norway, in the
  neighbourhood of the Lofoden Islands, the cod are sometimes so thickly packed in shoals that as
  the fishermen lower their tackle they can feel the leads hitting the backs of the fishes. Both
  there and off the Far&ouml;e Islands and Iceland it is common practice to fish with a hook bearing a
  little piece of polished lead on its shank, no other bait being required, owing to the cod being
  so numerous that food is scarce.</p>

  <p>About the commencement of the fifteenth century the English began to go to Iceland for cod, and
  since the sixteenth century English cod-fishing vessels have visited Newfoundland and other far
  northern waters, which produce fish superior to English cod. It should be mentioned that the Cod
  Family is not found to any extent in tropical seas.</p>

  <p>While the <span class="sc">Burbot</span> is one of the few species of the group inhabiting
  fresh-water, and is peculiar in living there permanently, there are instances recorded of <span
  class="sc">Pollack</span> having ascended from the salt water of the Norwegian fjords into
  fresh-water lakes, and it is an undoubted fact that many other species of sea-fish can accustom
  themselves to a residence in fresh-water.</p>

  </div>

  <p>All through the year cod frequent the British coasts; but it is two or three months before the
  spawning-season, which commences in January or later according to the locality, that they gather
  in vast shoals and come close inshore. First come the small codling of a pound or so, and as the
  winter approaches the longshore fish are found gradually to increase in size, until by
  Christmas-time it is no uncommon thing on the east coast of England and Scotland for fish of from
  10 to 20 lbs. to be caught from the beach.</p>

  <p>As a rule the eggs of cod float, owing to a little globule of oil which each one contains, but
  in water which lacks salinity they sink. The quantities of eggs shed by each fish are enormous;
  nearly two millions were counted in a cod of a little under 12 lbs. It is fairly certain, however,
  that not more than two or three, if so many, mature fish are the product of the two million eggs;
  for if each fish even doubled itself in numbers (if we may use the expression) every year, the sea
  would soon contain more fish than water. Millions upon millions of eggs are destroyed when there
  is an on-shore wind during the spawning-season. Sometimes the shore on which they have been wafted
  has been seen to glisten with them.</p>

  <p>By the end of summer such of the young cod-fish as have escaped their many dangers attain about
  1 inch in length. They are very varied in colour, which depends on that of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page643"><span class="smaller">{643}</span></span>seaweed and their other
  surroundings. The parent fish, too, vary somewhat in appearance, those round the English coast as
  a rule having brown backs with irregular spotty markings on the sides, while those from more
  northern waters usually have darker backs and are less often spotted. Cod are most enormous
  feeders, and in consequence grow very rapidly. At the Southport Aquarium codling of only &frac34; lb.
  increased in weight to 6 or 7 lbs. in about sixteen months.</p>

  <p class="sp5">So voracious is the cod that it is very apt to swallow anything it sees moving,
  without considering whether it is wholesome. In 1879 a black guillemot in perfect condition was
  removed from the stomach of one of these fish; while among other strange finds by cod-fishermen
  from the same receptacle was a piece of tallow candle 7 inches long, a hare, a partridge, a white
  turnip, and, going back to the year 1626, a "work in three treatises," which was found in the
  stomach of a fish captured in Lynn Deeps on midsummer eve, and brought to the Vice-Chancellor of
  Cambridge. The usual food of cod is, however, small fish of various kinds&mdash;herrings,
  pilchards, sprats, crabs, and sea-worms; but the species is not particular what it seizes when
  shoaling before the spawning-season and food is scarce owing to the number of mouths.</p>

  <p>The subterranean fresh-water caves of Cuba furnish the most interesting and most remarkable
  members of the family in certain small fishes known as <span class="sc">Cave-fishes</span>. Living
  in complete darkness, the eyes have degenerated so as to be no longer useful as organs of sight;
  indeed, in many species they are entirely wanting. By way of compensation delicate organs of touch
  have been developed, taking the form, in different species, of barbels, hair-like processes, or
  tubercles. These blind fishes are closely allied to certain marine forms found in the tropical
  Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and it is curious to note that amongst these about seven very rare
  species are found at great depths in the southern oceans, so great that light fails to reach them,
  and they too are blind.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sand-eels</span>, or <span class="sc">Launces</span>, are extremely common
  on the sandy shores of Europe and North America, living in vast shoals, and displaying a wonderful
  unison in their movements, rising and falling as with one accord. They burrow in the sand with
  amazing rapidity, forcing their way by means of a horny projection on the lower jaw, and remaining
  buried at ebb-tide some 5 or 6 inches under the sand, when they are captured by fishermen, armed
  with rakes, for bait. When swimming in shoals, their presence is often betrayed by schools of
  porpoises, which feed greedily upon them, preventing their return to the bottom by getting under
  the shoal, whilst others swim round it. Mackerel also make large raids upon the ranks of such
  shoals.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Flat-fishes</span> may be reckoned among the most important of food-fishes,
  and besides are of quite peculiar interest, on account of the remarkable modifications of
  structure which they have undergone. They differ from all other vertebrates in that, save for the
  first few weeks of existence, they spend the whole of their lives with one side of the body
  uppermost&mdash;the right or left, according to the species. Whether resting or swimming, this
  position holds good. The newly hatched fish, however, maintains the normal poise of the body, the
  back being uppermost. Of the many changes which the organs of the body undergo during this strange
  transformation from a "round" to a "flat" fish, one of the most interesting is that which concerns
  the eyes. These, in the very young fish, lie one on either side of the head; but as the fish grows
  older it begins to lie on its side on the ground, and ultimately, when it is two or three months
  old, loses the power of sustaining itself in an upright position altogether. The most remarkable
  feature in this very strange mode of development is, that as the fish comes to lie more and more
  on its side, so the eye which is undermost begins to move round to the other side, till eventually
  the two eyes lie side by side on the upper-surface. Strangely enough, in some species the eye
  moves <i>round</i> the head, passing over its edge, and so to its place beside the stationary eye,
  whilst in others it acquires its ultimate position by moving <i>through</i> the head, sinking in
  on one side and appearing again on the other. The coloration of these fishes is also peculiar, in
  that the two sides are quite differently coloured, the upper side resembling in tone that of the
  sea-bottom, whilst the under side is pure white. In the young fish, before the habit of lying on
  one side has been acquired, both sides are coloured alike. The difference in coloration between
  the two sides of the adult fish appears to be due to the effect of light, since in flat-fishes
  kept in a tank with <span class="pagenum" id="page645"><span class="smaller">{645}</span></span>a
  mirror at the bottom the under-surface was found in many cases to be very largely coloured. But
  the colour of the upper-surface is by no means constant. On the contrary, the flat-fish appears to
  possess the power, in common with all other fishes, of changing its colour so as to harmonise with
  the tone of its surroundings. Thus on a light sandy ground the exposed surface of the body becomes
  pale, while on a dark muddy bottom it is almost black. By this power of changing the colour of the
  exposed portion of the body so as to harmonise with the surroundings, the fish is enabled to
  become in a large measure invisible, and in proportion to the effectiveness of the change to
  escape its enemies. Some soles are quite invisible.</p>

  <p>The most important of the flat-fishes are the <span class="sc">Plaice</span>, <span
  class="sc">Flounder</span>, <span class="sc">Dab</span>, <span class="sc">Halibut</span>, <span
  class="sc">Sole</span>, <span class="sc">Turbot</span>, and <span class="sc">Brill</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Plaice</span> is one of the commonest of the British flat-fishes, and may
  be distinguished by the numerous orange or red spots which are scattered over the upper surface of
  the body. From 15 to 18 inches in length, specimens are occasionally captured which have attained
  a length of 28 inches. Plaice feed on shell-fish, such as mussels or scallops, which they crush by
  means of strong, blunt teeth in the throat; but worms are also eaten.</p>

  <p>The eggs of the plaice are amongst the largest fish-eggs known.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Flounder</span> is a smaller fish than the plaice, and lacks the red
  spots. It differs from the other flat-fishes in the preference it shows for the mouths of rivers,
  ascending these, indeed, so far as to enter fresh-water.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Halibut</span> is the largest of the flat-fishes, specimens of as much as
  20 feet in length being on record, while examples of from 6 to 7 feet long are not uncommon in
  Grimsby market. This fish has a wide distribution, occurring on both sides of the North Atlantic
  and North Pacific, being most abundant in deep water. The halibut which are brought into the
  markets of Grimsby and Hull are chiefly caught off the coasts of Iceland and the Far&ouml;es with long
  lines.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sole</span> is a shallow-water fish, feeding chiefly upon worms, crabs,
  and shrimps. These it apparently hunts by smell, gliding over the sea-bottom, and tapping with the

  filaments. By day it conceals itself by burrowing in the sand, coming out after dark to feed.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Turbot</span> resembles the brill, from which it may be distinguished by
  the greater breadth of the body in proportion to the length, the absence of scales, and the
  presence of large bony tubercles scattered over the surface. In Great Britain the turbot is most
  abundant in the English Channel.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The <span class="sc">Brill</span> closely resembles the turbot not only in general
  form, but in the numerical superiority of the females, and in the habits of the young, which, like
  the turbot, are surface-feeders and possess an air-bladder.</p>

  <p>Eels, like flat-fishes, show plainly, in the shape of their bodies, a remarkably perfect
  adaptation to their environment. They are burrowing fishes, passing much of their time buried in
  the mud, and leaving little more than the head exposed. In accordance with this habit, the body is
  very long and round, and lacks both the hinder paired fins, and scales. When swimming, the body is
  propelled by rapid undulations, the movement being from side to side, it may be remarked, instead
  of up and down, as in the "serpentine" movements of snakes.</p>

  <p>Whether all the fishes commonly regarded as eels really belong to this family or not is a
  moot-point. It is possible that the eel shape has been independently acquired by unrelated forms
  as a result of adaptation to a similar mode of life. But as the group now stands it embraces
  several distinct types,&mdash;the <span class="sc">Common Fresh-water Eels</span>; numerous marine
  species, such as <span class="sc">Congers</span>, <span class="sc">Serpent-eels</span>, <span
  class="sc">Deep-sea Eels</span>, and <span class="sc">Painted Eels</span>; and the fresh-water
  <span class="sc">Electric Eels</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">River-eels</span> and <span class="sc">Congers</span> are perhaps the best
  known, and are also highly important food-fishes. That they are fishes of comparatively slow
  growth seems to be shown by the <span class="pagenum" id="page647"><span
  class="smaller">{647}</span></span>fact that the common eel takes about four or five years to
  attain a weight of between 5 and 6 lbs. The males are smaller than the females, the greatest
  length attained by the former being a little over 1 foot 7 inches, whilst the latter may attain a
  length of nearly 4 feet. For a long while what is now known to be the female river-eel was
  regarded as a distinct species&mdash;the <span class="sc">Sharp-nosed Eel</span>. The two sexes
  have quite different habits, the smaller males being found mostly in the brackish water of
  river-mouths, and rarely above the reach of the tides, whilst the females ascend the rivers for
  great distances, thousands finding their way into isolated ponds, which they reach by travelling
  overland. Here they appear to remain till they have reached maturity, when they migrate with one
  accord to the sea. Coming down the rivers during the months of October and November, hundreds are
  taken in large niches with traps, the mouths of which are directed up-stream.</p>

  <p>The migration of eels to the sea is for the sole purpose of spawning and fertilising the eggs,
  which done, they die. The spawning appears to take place in extremely deep water, where the young
  eels pass the earlier stages of their development. Like the majority of young fishes, the fry are
  at first very different in form from the adults, and many have from time to time been described as
  distinct species, no suspicion of their true nature having been aroused. And this is not to be
  wondered at, for at this stage they are perfectly transparent and compressed from side to side, so
  as to be but little thicker than a sheet of stout paper; the head is ridiculously small, and only
  median fins are present. As development proceeds, having reached a certain maximum size, they,
  strangely enough, begin to slowly diminish, growing shorter and at the same time rounder, so that
  eventually, by the time the characteristic eel form is attained, they are considerably shorter
  than they were at the maximum period of larval life.</p>

  <p>By the time the adult eel form has been attained, the larv&aelig; have made their way to the mouths
  of various rivers, preparatory to making their ascent, which takes place between <span
  class="pagenum" id="page648"><span class="smaller">{648}</span></span>February and May. They are
  then from 2 to 5 inches long, and perfectly transparent save for a black line inside the body,
  running along the spinal cord. The numbers passing up a single river during this ascent are almost
  beyond belief. In one of these migrations, or "eel-fares," upwards of three tons were captured in
  a single day in the Gloucester district in 1886, and it has been calculated that more than 14,000
  go to make a pound weight. In the previous year the annual consumption of eels was estimated at a
  minimum of 1,650 tons, with a total value of &pound;130,000. Few obstacles seem too great to be overcome
  in their ascent, for they will ascend the flood-gates of locks, or even travel overland if the
  ground be wet, till a desirable resting-place is found. In some parts of England these young eels,
  or "elvers," as they are called, are salted and made into cakes.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Conger-eel</span> is a marine species, differing from the river-eel,
  amongst other things, in its larger head and eyes, and in the arrangement of its teeth and the
  large size of the gill-openings. The conger is also greatly superior in size, examples of between
  6 and 7 feet in length and 60 lbs. in weight being common. The females are larger than the males,
  and an instance is on record of a female which was over 8 feet in length and weighed 128 lbs.
  Congers feed on other fishes, cuttle-fishes, and lobsters, as well as upon one another, the larger
  females eating the smaller males.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Deep-sea Eels</span> are represented by numerous species, and dwell at
  depths varying from 340 to 2,000 fathoms. In some species the body is remarkably modified, the

  eels of this family have been captured which had swallowed fishes several times their own weight.
  The tail in many of the deep-sea eels tapers to a fine hair-like point.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Painted Eels</span> are remarkable for their bright spotted or mottled

  <p>The <span class="sc">Electric Eel</span> is an extremely abundant fish in the rivers and
  lagoons of Brazil and the Guianas. It is the most powerful of the electric fishes, and attains a
  length of 6 feet. The electric organs of this fish are sufficiently strong to kill by their shock
  other fishes and even mammals. The traveller Humboldt is responsible for the statement, now
  generally discredited, that the Indians procured this fish by driving horses into the water, and
  so provoking such violent discharges from the fish that they became exhausted and fell an easy
  prey.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Cat-fishes</span>, or <span class="sc">Sheath-fishes</span>, are an
  extremely interesting group, one of the principal characteristics of which is the total absence of
  scales, the body being either entirely naked or armed with bony tubercles or overlapping plates.
  Another peculiarity of these fishes is the presence of feelers round the mouth; these, by their
  delicate sense of touch, enable the fish to procure its food in extremely muddy water, when the
  eyes would be useless. The latter, indeed, in many species are extremely reduced in size. Many
  cat-fishes are armed with powerful spines, attached to the body by a very complicated mechanism.
  Such spines are capable of inflicting dangerous wounds, either by the introduction of poison or
  the violent inflammation following on the laceration of the wounded part. Some species have
  elaborate accessory breathing-organs, enabling them to travel overland for short distances from
  one piece of water to another. Other members of the group possess electrical organs of
  considerable power; one species inhabiting the Nile attains a length of 4 feet.</p>

  <p>The nesting-habits of the group are exceedingly interesting, some building nests in which to
  deposit the eggs; others carry the eggs in the mouth till they hatch. In one species the care of
  the eggs is undertaken by the female, which carries them about embedded in the skin of the under
  surface of the body, which at this season becomes very soft and spongy. When the eggs are laid,
  she presses them into the spongy skin by lying on them.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The cat-fishes are of world-wide distribution, but only one species, the <span
  class="sc">Wels</span>, occurs in European waters. It commonly attains a length of from 6 to 9
  feet, and occasionally as much as 13 feet. The majority of cat-fishes inhabit fresh-water, but
  some are marine.</p>

  <p>The Carp Family, like the Perch group, is one of the largest among fishes. It includes the
  Rudd, Roach, Tench, Bream, Minnow, etc., and is divided into many groups, which again include
  numerous species found chiefly in the temperate and tropical parts of the world. Included among
  these are the Barbels, of which there are about 200 species, varying from little fishes of 2
  inches <span class="pagenum" id="page651"><span class="smaller">{651}</span></span>to monsters of
  6 feet or more in length. Some of the largest are found in the Tigris; but the Mahseer of India
  must be regarded as the king of all the species. In some of the rivers flowing from the Himalaya
  Mountains are curious Barbel which have their vent and anal fin in a sheath covered with large
  scales. Roach are important members of the Carp Family, and the Roach group is a very large one,
  including the various fishes coming under the term of "white fish" in Germany. The Roach proper is
  common all over Europe north of the Alps. In this group is the Ide of the central and northern
  parts of Europe, which when domesticated becomes golden in hue, and is then called the Golden Orf,
  a pretty fish kept in many English aquariums. Rudd are found all over Europe and Asia Minor. Of
  Tench, only one species is known, the Golden Tench being merely a variety differing in the matter
  of colour. The Bream group consists of the Common Bream, Bream-flat, and the American Bream, or
  Shiner. Lastly, we may mention the Bleak group, of which there are fifteen known species in
  Europe, East Africa, and the temperate parts of Asia. This list by no means exhausts the numerous
  members of the Carp Family.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Common Carp</span> is one of the most remarkable fishes which swim. In
  early times in England it was extensively cultivated as a food-fish, and in Germany at the present
  day is as much domesticated as the sheep, pig, or ox. The fish-culturists have indeed done
  extraordinary things with it, having, for instance, produced a variety with a single row of scales
  down each side and sometimes on the back only, called the <span class="sc">Mirror-carp</span>, or
  <span class="sc">King-carp</span>. There is also the <span class="sc">Leather-carp</span>, with no
  scales at all, which is much esteemed in Germany.</p>

  <p>There is reason to believe that the common carp was originally a native of the East, and it
  certainly has been domesticated in China for many hundreds of years. Thence it is supposed to have
  been imported to Germany and Sweden, reaching England some time in the early years of the
  fifteenth century. In that curious work the "Boke of St. Albans," published in 1496, it is said
  that the carp is a "dayntous fysshe, but there ben fewe in Englonde, and therefore I wryte the
  lesse of hym."</p>

  <p>China is the home of the <span class="sc">Gold-fish</span>, a pretty little carp common in that
  country and the warmer parts of Japan. The Chinese have distorted Nature with regard to this fish
  even more than the Germans have the common carp. Their most extraordinary monstrosity is, perhaps,
  the <span class="sc">Telescope-fish</span>, which has a huge tail and projecting eyes. It is
  believed that gold-fish were not known in England before the year 1691.</p>

  <p>The carp has many interesting peculiarities. It is an extraordinarily fertile fish, and one of
  the most rapid growers in fresh-water. Under the most favourable conditions it attains a weight of
  from 3 to 3&frac12; lbs. in three years. In a pond which is overstocked, carp hardly increase in weight
  at all; while, on the other hand, their growth in hot countries is very much greater than above
  stated. A fish of from 4 to 5 lbs. may contain, on an average, from 400,000 to 500,000 eggs; these
  are spawned in May or June, and hatched in from twelve to sixteen days, according to the
  temperature.</p>

  <p>The life of this curious fish may be one of extraordinary duration, carp having been known to
  attain an age of a hundred years or more. When very old, they are apt to go blind and develop
  white marks, due to the growth of funguses.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page652"><span class="smaller">{652}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the winter carp either bury themselves in the mud, or lie among the water-weeds or roots of
  trees at the bottom. They are vegetarians for the most part, with no teeth in their mouths, but
  strong, powerful grinding-teeth in their throats; they are believed to regurgitate their food and
  chew it, somewhat as a cow chews the cud.</p>

  <p>With regard to the weight which this fish attains, one of 19 lbs. was taken at Sheffield Park
  in 1882. This was exceptionally large; but one still larger, weighing 21 lbs. 10 ozs., was caught
  at Bayham Abbey, near Lamberhurst, in 1870; while one of 22 lbs. was exhibited many years ago to
  the Zoological Society. In the German lakes these fish reach a weight of 40 lbs., or even
  more.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Carp will, however, occasionally eat small fish, and have even been caught with a
  salmon-fly.</p>

  <p>The Pikes are strictly fresh-water fishes, which are extremely voracious, and grow to a large
  size. They are met with in most of the fresh-waters of Europe, Asia, and America; yet they must be
  regarded rather as a Western than an Eastern type, since all the known species occur in America,
  whilst only one&mdash;the Common Pike&mdash;is known outside that country. These fishes capture
  their prey by stealth&mdash;practised, however, not so much by concealment as by lying suspended
  in the water, perfectly motionless save for the movement of the gills, which is barely
  perceptible. When the victim comes within reach, it is seized by a sudden rush. The form of the
  body is admirably adapted to this manner of feeding, resembling rather a submerged log than a
  fish. It is, furthermore, on account of this shape that the name Pike has been bestowed, since it
  recalls the "pike" borne by the soldiers of bygone days.</p>

  <p>When on the feed, nothing comes amiss to pike, and the havoc they commit in trout-streams is
  enormous. Not only other fishes are devoured, but both the young and adults of water-birds are
  frequently seized, and instances are on record where boys have been attacked while bathing. The
  mouth of a pike bristles with teeth, even the roof being thickly covered. These are all attached
  by hinges, moving readily backwards towards the throat, so as to assist the swallowing operation,
  but preventing any possibility of the victim's escape.</p>

  <p>In Great Britain the pike is held in high esteem by anglers, though as an article of food it
  does not find much favour. The females are larger than the males. The largest specimens attain a
  length of about 4 feet, sometimes a little more, and a weight of from 36 to 37 lbs.</p>

  fastened to the arrow, thus converting it into a harpoon.</p>

  <p>Four species of arapaimas are distinguished by the presence of "barbels" on the chin; of these,
  two are Australian, one American, and one occurs in Sumatra and Borneo. Yet another species is
  found in the Nile and the rivers of West Africa. The Australian species, like the large Brazilian
  form, are highly esteemed as food; one of these, known as the <span class="sc">Dawson River
  Salmon</span>, is confined to the rivers of Queensland, the other to the rivers emptying into the
  Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Beaked Salmon</span> occurs in the open seas of the Cape, Japan, and
  Australia; but in New Zealand, where it is known as the <span class="sc">Sand-eel</span>, it is
  found in bays with a sandy bottom.</p>

  <p>The group of fishes known as <span class="sc">Scopelids</span> is one of particular interest,
  on account of the number of remarkable forms which it contains. For the most part they are
  inhabitants of the open sea, many being found only at great depths. Of the latter, some apparently
  come to the surface to feed at night, whilst others are entirely confined to the abysses of the
  ocean. As with the members of other groups which have adopted a deep-sea habitat, certain
  modifications of the body have become necessary in these fishes. Many of them have a direct
  relation to the absence of light, which has rendered normal eyes of little use; consequently the
  eyes of these fishes have become either greatly reduced or enormously enlarged, or sometimes lost
  altogether. As a rule the large-eyed forms are those which come to the surface at night or do not
  live beyond the reach of daylight; whilst those in which the eyes are small or reduced live in the
  very lowest depths, far beyond the limit of daylight. In all these forms compensation for the loss
  of light has taken place, generally by the development of phosphorescent organs. These may take
  the form of a number of luminous areas distributed down each side of the body, as in the <span
  class="sc">Phosphorescent Sardine</span>; or of a pair of lens-like light-producing organs,
  occupying the place of the eyes of other fishes. Another eyeless member of the group, instead of
  developing light-producing organs, has increased the length of the rays of the paired fins to an
  enormous extent, so that they serve as delicate feelers either for the discovery of food or the
  detection of enemies. Many of the fishes of this group have extremely large mouths, armed with a
  formidable array of tusk-like teeth, between which are numerous smaller ones.</p>

  <p>As food-fishes the majority of the Scopelids are not of much value. The species known as the
  <span class="sc">Queensland Smelt</span>, shown in the adjoining photograph, is an edible species,
  occurring off the north-west coast of Australia. Its near ally, the <span
  class="sc">Bummaloe</span>, or <span class="sc">Bombay Duck</span>, however, enjoys a quite
  exceptional notoriety. Salted and dried, it is exported in large quantities <span class="pagenum"
  id="page655"><span class="smaller">{655}</span></span>from Bombay and the coast of Malabar, and
  forms an indispensable adjunct to an Indian curry. This fish apparently inhabits considerable
  depths, and when freshly taken is brilliantly phosphorescent. Another edible species is the "<span
  class="sc">Sergeant Baker</span>" of Australia, of which a photograph is given on page <a
  href="#page653">653</a>.</p>

  <p class="sp5">With regard to the deep-sea Scopelids, it is interesting to note that, in addition
  to very remarkable modifications of the eyes and fins, and the production of phosphorescent light,
  certain of the body-cavities are characterised by an intensely black coloration. The inside of the
  mouth, the gills, and the lining of the abdomen, for example, are always so coloured in those
  fishes which inhabit the deepest abysses. This coloration is difficult to account for, but it is
  generally supposed to be due to excretory products. Another interesting point concerns the
  air-bladder. Whenever this organ is present in the fishes of this or any other family inhabiting
  the abysses of the ocean, it bursts before the unfortunate victim is brought to the surface, owing
  to the enormous differences in pressure which obtain between the depths of the sea and the
  surface.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>THE SALMON FAMILY.</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">BY SIR HERBERT MAXWELL, BART., F.R.S.</span></p>

  <p>Although the Salmon Family occupies a low place in the classification of fishes, yet every
  member thereof is possessed of singular beauty of form and colour. The <span class="sc">Atlantic
  Salmon</span>, which is the species frequenting European rivers and those of the eastern coast of
  North America, may be considered the type of the family, and certainly it would be difficult to
  name any animal more perfectly adapted to its peculiar mode of life, which is one of constant
  activity. A native of fresh-water, hatched in early spring from eggs laid in rivers during the
  winter months, it spends from fifteen to twenty-seven months in the shallows of the river, almost
  indistinguishable in habits and appearance from a small common trout. Sometimes in the second
  spring after its birth, and failing that, always in the third spring, the fish, having attained
  the length of 5 or 6 inches, undergoes a wonderful change: its prevailing tints of olive and gold
  become overspread with a glittering coat of silver, known <span class="pagenum" id="page656"><span
  class="smaller">{656}</span></span>to anglers as the "sea-jacket," and shoals of "smolts," as they
  are called in this stage, begin descending to the sea. In about fifteen or eighteen months,
  perhaps in some instances longer, they return to the inland waters as "grilse"&mdash;small salmon
  from 2 to 5 lbs. in weight. Grilse and mature salmon spawn chiefly in November and December,
  undergoing, before they do so, another strange metamorphosis. Their brilliant silvery scales
  become darkly discoloured, the males turning copper-colour, the females blackish and dull purple;
  their elegant form becoming distorted to such a degree as to render them hardly recognisable as
  the same fish which left the tide in the perfection of beauty. In their efforts to reach the
  higher waters where they spawn, salmon display extraordinary perseverance and activity in
  surmounting weirs, waterfalls, and other obstacles which bar their way. After spawning, the fish
  are emaciated and lanky, but speedily regain the bright silver hue so characteristic of the
  species. In this state they are usually known as "kelts"; they are worthless either for food or
  for sport, and make their way back to the sea, where abundant provender soon restores their
  condition. Their chief food consists of herrings, haddocks, and other small fishes. Dr. Kingston
  Barton recently recorded finding five full-grown herrings in the stomach of one salmon. Although
  the excellence of their flesh exposes salmon to the attacks of innumerable foes, including man,
  predacious fishes, seals, and cetaceans, a few survive for many years and attain to great size.
  Fish weighing from 30 to 40 lbs. are far from uncommon; one of 60 lbs. has been taken in the Tay
  with rod and line, and the same river has yielded one of upwards of 70 lbs. to the nets. The fine
  sport afforded to anglers by the salmon causes a good beat on a prolific river to be a very
  valuable property. Two thousand pounds was the season's rent paid a few years ago for less than
  three miles of the Tweed, and the season happened to be such a bad one that the lessee only killed
  thirteen fish!</p>

      <p class="sp3">SALMON-TROUT.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Known also as the Sea-trout, and in Ireland as the White Trout.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Closely resembling the true salmon in habits and appearance, and sometimes rivalling it even in
  size, are two kinds of sea-trout&mdash;the <span class="sc">Salmon-trout</span>, greatly prized
  both for its sporting qualities and for the excellence of its flesh, and the <span
  class="sc">Bull-trout</span>, a very inferior fish in both respects. Bull-trout are not
  infrequently taken in the Tay weighing upwards of 40 lbs.</p>

  <p>The Pacific Ocean has its counterpart to the Atlantic salmon and sea-trout in several closely
  allied species, whereof the <span class="sc">Quinnat</span> and the <span
  class="sc">Steelhead</span> are the most notable. These ascend the great rivers of Western North
  America in prodigious shoals, penetrating more than 2,000  miles inland to deposit their spawn.
  Few of these fish survive to return to the sea. In their emaciated condition they succumb to
  exhaustion and starvation; their corpses, piled to the height of several feet, line the banks of
  the river for miles, and contribute nothing to the traveller's comfort. Although Pacific salmon
  are of no value to the sportsman, as they are said to refuse any bait in fresh-water, yet they are
  the staple of an important trade, tens of thousands of tons being taken and canned for export.</p>

  <p>If we could peer far enough back into the course of time, we should no doubt be able to
  identify a common stock from which all the Salmon Family are descended. That they are all natives
  of fresh-water is proved by the fact that they cannot reproduce their kind in the sea. Those that
  resort to the ocean for food must be the descendants of vigorous, roving members of the family,
  which, having to choose between starvation and migration, braved the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page657"><span class="smaller">{657}</span></span>perils of travel, and became so much altered
  in constitution by the liberal diet they found as to establish themselves as separate species.</p>

  <p>Among the stay-at-homes there are many interesting and beautiful fishes. None of them exhibit
  the variable nature of the family more than the common <span class="sc">Brook-trout</span> of
  British waters, and not long since men of science dignified each of these varieties by a separate
  title, treating them as distinct species. However, experiment and observation have now led to the
  almost unanimous conclusion that the pygmy denizens of some hungry Highland burn, whereof the
  weight must be reckoned in fractions of ounces, are of precisely the same species as the lordly
  trout of deep lakes, which sometimes scales as much as 25 lbs., and as all the other innumerable
  varieties, such as the trout of the Thames, of the English chalk-streams, and of the Irish loughs.
  The quality of the soil affects the food-supply, which in turn regulates the size and appearance
  of the fish. Moreover, Nature seems indifferent to the number of individuals composing the
  population which the water is to sustain. If there are no pike, and spawning-ground is abundant,
  there will be many and small fish; if the contrary is the case, there will be few and large ones;
  the aggregate weight per acre of water will remain the same, proportioned to the food-supply. The
  American equivalent of the British brook-trout is the <span class="sc">Rainbow-trout</span>, a
  beautiful creature which has lately been widely distributed in European waters. What is known as
  the brook-trout in America really belongs to the Char group, fish of the Salmon Family, closely
  resembling trout, but distinguished from them by extraordinary brilliancy of colour. Common trout,
  like salmon, lose all their beauty as the spawning-season approaches. Char, on the other hand,
  take gaudy colouring at that time, the whole of the under-parts becoming clear red or
  flame-colour. Unlike trout, British char never enter rivers, but spawn in lakes. In Norway,
  however, char descend to the sea. The distribution of char is indeed mysterious, nor has any
  explanation been offered why they inhabit certain waters, while other lakes in the neighbourhood,
  apparently equally suitable, contain none.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Grayling</span> is an elegant member of the Salmon Family, and a deserved
  favourite with fly-fishers. Instead of the golden tints and scarlet spots of the brook-trout, this
  fish displays the silvery colouring of the salmon-trout. It is not at all uncommon to meet with
  grayling in the chalk-streams of Southern England weighing 3 lbs. and upwards.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Powan</span> is the type of another large group of salmon-like fishes,
  inhabiting lakes in the temperate and subarctic regions of both hemispheres. There are four
  species in Great Britain, among which may be mentioned the mysterious <span
  class="sc">Vendace</span> of Lochmaben, unknown to exist elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the Salmon Family is closed by the delicate <span class="sc">Smelt</span>, called in
  Scotland the <span class="sc">Sparling</span>, which is netted in vast numbers in the estuaries of
  suitable rivers. It never ascends beyond the highest point of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page658"><span class="smaller">{658}</span></span>tide, where it deposits its spawn in the
  spring months. It is a gratifying tribute to the good work done of late years by the local
  authorities in purifying the Thames that, after a long absence, this valuable fish has reappeared
  in that river, which it now ascends in considerable numbers as high as Teddington Weir.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Much discussion has taken place recently with regard to the question whether salmon
  feed while in fresh-water. Not long ago it was announced that they suffered from a diseased
  condition of the stomach during this period, and were consequently quite unable to feed.
  Subsequently it was found that the supposed diseased condition of the stomach was due to the
  fishes not being perfectly fresh when they were examined. It is now known that although salmon do
  not feed freely in fresh-water, yet they take a certain amount of nutriment, such as an occasional
  shrimp, fly, or even small fish, while there.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>THE HERRING AND ITS KINDRED.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3 ac"><span class="smaller">BY F. G. AFLALO, F.Z.S.</span></p>

  <p>"King herring," as the trade-paper of the fishing industry rightly calls it, is one of the
  chief commercial fishes of the British seas, and the enormous North Sea herring fisheries probably
  support more boats and men from all parts than any other. Europe has no very large herring; but
  the <span class="sc">Tarpon</span> of the Mexican coast, as well as another giant which occurs in
  the northern waters of Australia, grows to an enormous size. All the members of the Herring Family
  feed and travel near the surface of the sea, and are therefore caught in drift-nets, miles of
  which are "shot" a few fathoms from the top of the water, catching the shoaling-fish in their
  meshes. All of them, too, are wanderers, most capricious in their goings and comings. Hence the
  uncertainty of the fisherman's wage.</p>

  <p>The principal kinsmen of the herring in British seas are the <span class="sc">Sprat</span> and
  <span class="sc">Pilchard</span>, though the two kinds of <span class="sc">Shad</span>, which,
  like the salmon, ascend certain rivers for spawning purposes, also support a number fishermen; and
  the <span class="sc">Anchovy</span> is, authorities have lately suspected, sufficiently numerous
  on the British coasts to repay a regular fishery, if the men could be induced to try the
  experiment and use a sufficiently fine-meshed net for this little fish.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Herring</span> of the more northern waters is larger than that of the
  English Channel, 17 inches being recorded as its maximum size in the former, as against only 12&frac14;
  inches farther south. In the Baltic, however, the writer found the herrings still smaller than
  those of the English Channel. The herring lacks the lateral line, already alluded to in other
  fishes; its scales are large and thin; its under-edge is smooth and keeled; and the male is
  slightly the larger of the two sexes. The <span class="sc">Sprat</span>, on the other hand, is a
  smaller species. It has no teeth; its belly is saw-edged; its back-fin starts nearer the tail than
  that of the herring. The herring, moreover, differs from the sprat, and indeed from all our most
  important fishes, in that its eggs sink to the bottom. The eggs of almost all other sea-fish float
  at or near the surface of the sea, so that the herring's spawn alone can be damaged by the
  operations of the <span class="pagenum" id="page659"><span
  class="smaller">{659}</span></span>ground-sweeping trawl-net. The shad's eggs also sink to the
  bottom, but are deposited in the less buoyant waters of rivers.</p>

      <p class="sp3">OX-EYED HERRING.</p>
      <p class="sp0">This species attains a length of several feet.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Pilchard</span>, the all-important fish (together with mackerel) on the
  south-west coast of England, is of a more decided green hue than either of the foregoing. Its
  scales are large and coarse, and its back-fin starts closer to the head than in the rest. The
  pilchard of Cornwall and the sardine of the Mediterranean are one and the same fish in different
  stages of growth&mdash;that is to say, the pilchard is a grown-up sardine. The late Matthias Dunn
  of Mevagissey was one of the first practical fishermen to accept this identity, and the
  flourishing sardine factory at his native town bears lasting witness to his enterprise. Although,
  from the economic standpoint, we associate the pilchard with the extreme south-west of the English
  Channel, the fish finds its way to more eastern counties. The writer has found it at both
  Bournemouth and Ventnor; and it is taken, though sparsely, in the herring-nets of the North Sea
  fleets.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Anchovy</span>, smaller than any of the foregoing, may be distinguished by
  its projecting, shark-like snout and deeply cleft mouth. It is seen in England only pickled for
  table purposes, but the writer used fresh anchovies for bait almost daily during a stay of four
  months on the shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>The two shads&mdash;the <span class="sc">Allis Shad</span> and <span class="sc">Twaite
  Shad</span>&mdash;are in some respects, though less important commercially, the most interesting
  of the family. Their habit of coming up rivers to spawn, like salmon, has been already noticed,
  but they appear to be more difficult to please than the other fish. The Severn used to be a noted
  shad-river, but the fishery has fallen off of late years. The <span class="sc">Allis Shad</span>
  grows to a weight of 7 or 8 lbs., and its pale green and silver scales are varied by some darker
  spots at irregular intervals on the shoulders and sides. The edge of the belly is serrated, like
  that of the sprat. The fish has a curious transparent eyelid, and its other peculiarities include
  an abnormally large number of gill-rakers, through which the water filters much as it does through
  the "whalebone" of whales. Its food is said to consist of small fishes and shrimps, as well as of
  vegetable substances. Though usually caught, for market purposes, in a seine-net, which is slipped
  round the shoal in shallow water, the shad is now and then taken on the hook, and instances of
  this are on record in the neighbourhood of Deal. The rivers of Morocco are very productive of
  shad, particularly the <span class="sc">Bouregreg</span> at Rabat, and the <span class="sc">Um
  Erbeya</span> at Azimur. At the latter town the writer has bought newly caught shad weighing 5 or
  6 lbs. for native money equivalent to as many pence, <span class="pagenum" id="page660"><span
  class="smaller">{660}</span></span>and very excellent fish they proved in camp. The <span
  class="sc">Twaite Shad</span> is a somewhat smaller fish, attaining to a maximum weight of perhaps
  a couple of pounds. It is not known to differ materially in habits from the larger species.</p>

  <p>Reverting for a moment to the herring as a type of the family, a few words may be said on some
  very interesting facts in connection with its life-history and commercial uses. In the first
  place, the fact that the spawn sinks to the bottom is of more importance than would at first sight
  appear, since it not only exposes this spawn to disturbance by the trawl, but also subjects it to
  the voracity of cod, haddock, and other ground-feeding fishes. Some little protection is afforded
  by a natural provision which enables the eggs to adhere to stones and weeds, but this cannot in
  the long-run be of much service against prowling fishes. The eggs of the shad, which likewise sink
  (in fresh-water), do not adhere in this way.</p>

  <p>The migrations of the herring, again, have furnished almost as much material for argument to
  marine biologists as the migrations of birds in ornithological circles. Older naturalists
  described marvellous Arctic journeyings with careful attention to detail, much of which is now
  repudiated. Later theories hold that the shoals of herrings simply move, according to changes in
  the weather and temperature, backwards and forwards between the shore and the deeper water
  outside; and so far as the fishermen are concerned, the mere fact of the fish moving at any season
  of the year beyond reach of their drift-nets, which work at only moderate distances from the land,
  would be quite sufficient to convince them that the absent fish had departed on world-wide
  travels. Much of the former acceptance of these extensive migrations may have been due to
  confusion between the goings and comings of the different races of herrings now recognised by
  biologists. It is also probable that, when the identity and movements of these different "races"
  are more firmly established, we shall be able to clear up many of the difficulties at present
  surrounding the spawning-time of the herring, and to show that it does not, as sometimes alleged,
  deposit its spawn at every season of the year indiscriminately, but that some herrings spawn at
  one season, some at another. Although the herring is not, individually and by comparison with some
  other sea-fish, an enormously fertile fish, its numbers must be fairly large, when we bear in mind
  that something like 50,000  crans a week are, in good seasons, packed in Shetland alone. Taking,
  as an average, 750 fish to the cran, this gives a weekly curing of not far short of 40,000,000 of
  herrings in a single fishery. Owing indeed to the property, already noted, of adhering to stones
  <span class="pagenum" id="page661"><span class="smaller">{661}</span></span>and rocks, it is
  improbable that even the trawl troubles the eggs to any appreciable extent, as the stony ground on
  which the herrings generally spawn is not suited to the operations of the trawler. The spawning
  and life-history of the herring are, in fact, the converse of those of the plaice. The former
  deposits its eggs on the ground close inshore, and the young herrings, almost as soon as they are
  hatched, steer for the open sea and live near the surface of the water. The flat-fishes, on the
  other hand, deposit eggs that float at the surface some distance from the shore; and the young
  plaice and soles, when hatched, come inshore and take up their residence close to the bed of the
  sea.</p>

  comparatively late in the last century whitebait was regarded, even by scientific men, as a
  distinct species, and there were even some who declared that they had identified peculiar
  characters. It is now, however, common knowledge that the so-called "whitebait" is neither more
  nor less than a mixture of young herrings and sprats, the former predominating in summer, the
  latter in winter. Other fishes are also found in the dish, and, appropriately enough, at a recent
  banquet given by the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, at which the writer had the pleasure of
  "assisting," a plate of whitebait was found to include no sprats, but the fry of herrings,
  gurnards, and sand-eels: this was in the month of July. Whitebait are caught in special
  fine-meshed nets in river-estuaries; and although they make a capital dish for the epicure, the
  large supplies needed for the restaurants probably entail a most regrettable sacrifice of valuable
  food-fishes, which, if left a year or two, would provide food for ten times the number of
  consumers. It would, however, be too much to expect that epicures should give up such an
  unrivalled dish for this cause. Moreover, if these little fishes were not captured by man, it is
  highly probable that a large proportion would fall victims to birds or other fishes.</p>

  <p>The present chapter deals with the remaining forms belonging to that great assemblage of fishes
  known as the Bony-mouthed group, which includes all the members of the class save the Lung-fishes
  on the one hand and the Shark Tribe on the other.</p>

  <p>This great assemblage, as we have already remarked, is divided into two sections&mdash;the Fan-
  and Fringe-finned Fishes. The fishes presently to be described belong partly to the one and partly
  to the other of these divisions, and were at one time, together with the Lung-fishes, regarded as
  nearly allied, and as forming but a single group, which, on account of the structure of the
  scales, was known as the Enamel-scaled group.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Bony Pike</span>, the <span class="sc">Bow-fin</span>, and the <span
  class="sc">Sturgeon</span> are the last of the Fan-finned Fishes.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Bony Pike</span>, or <span class="sc">Gar-pike</span>, is an inhabitant of
  the fresh-waters of North America, and has the most completely ossified skeleton and the most
  perfectly jointed backbone of all the fishes, whilst externally it is covered with a complete
  armour of thick, quadrangular scales coated with enamel. Three distinct species of this family are
  known, all of which are of large size, attaining a length of 6 feet. They are carnivorous in their
  habits, lying in wait among the reeds, and rushing out to seize their prey as soon as within
  range. In the Mississippi, great lakes, and rivers of South Carolina bony pike are especially
  abundant, occurring at times in such numbers as to fill the shad-nets and render the fishery for
  many days impossible. The larger members are said to be as aggressive as sharks, and remarkably
  tenacious of life.</p>

  <p>The geographical distribution of the <span class="sc">Bow-fin</span> closely corresponds with
  that of the bony pike. It is an extremely common fish, and, though worthless for food purposes,
  has yet been deemed worthy of a number of different names, such as <span
  class="sc">Grindle</span>, <span class="sc">Dog-fish</span>, <span class="sc">Sawyer</span>, <span
  class="sc">Mud-fish</span>, and <span class="sc">Lawyer-fish</span>. At one time it was regarded
  as a near ally of the Herring Tribe, but modern research has shown this view to be erroneous. The
  bow-fin attains a length of about 2 feet, and is very voracious, preying both upon other fishes
  and aquatic insects and shrimps. It has a habit of coming frequently to the surface to breathe,
  especially when the water is foul, taking in large mouthfuls of air. When near the surface, it is
  said to utter a bell-like note, <span class="pagenum" id="page663"><span
  class="smaller">{663}</span></span>probably caused by the escape of air from the air-bladder.
  During the breeding-season the male takes entire charge of the eggs.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sturgeons</span> differ from the other fan-finned fishes in many
  particulars. To begin with, the skeleton is almost entirely cartilaginous instead of bony, whilst
  externally the body is either naked or covered with bony bucklers, arranged symmetrically. The
  snout is prolonged into a more or less shovel-shaped beak, used for turning over the mud at the
  bottom of the water in search of prey, and in some forms this becomes further developed into a
  spoon-shaped paddle, constituting one of the most remarkable appendages of fishes.</p>

  <p>Sturgeons grow to a large size, and are the largest of the fresh-water fishes of the northern
  hemisphere. The <span class="sc">Giant Sturgeon</span> of the Black and Caspian Seas and the Sea
  of Azoff attains a length of 24 feet, and sometimes more, specimens of 3,200 lbs. weight having
  been recorded.</p>

  <p>On account of the wholesomeness of their flesh, sturgeons are highly esteemed wherever they are
  found. In Russian rivers they are very abundant, regular fishing-stations being established for
  their capture. The approach of a shoal of fish is announced by a watchman, and it is said as many
  as 15,000  sturgeon have been captured at one of these stations in a single day. Should the
  fishing be suspended for a short time, the fish assemble in such numbers as to form a solid mass,
  completely blocking a river 400 feet in width and 25 feet in depth.</p>

  <p>With the Sturgeons we come to the end of the Fan-finned Fishes. The Fringe-finned group are
  represented to-day only by the <span class="sc">Bichir</span> and the <span
  class="sc">Reed-fish</span>. These are extremely interesting forms, if only because they are the
  sole survivors of a once numerous tribe, the remains of which occur as fossils in some of the
  oldest geological formations. They are known as Fringe-finned on account of the fact that the rays
  which support the fin-membrane in the paired fins are ranged round a lobe-shaped base, instead of
  running directly backwards to the body. As in the bony pike, the body is clothed externally by
  large quadrangular bony plates of considerable thickness, and coated with a layer of enamel.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Bichir</span>, which is found in the Nile and other tropical rivers of
  Africa, is easily recognised by the peculiar structure of the back-fin, which takes the form of a
  series of detached finlets, varying in number from eight to eighteen. The length attained by the
  bichir is about 4 feet. Gill-breathing is supplemented by the air-bladder, which is used as a
  respiratory organ, the expired air escaping by a slit, known as the "spiracle." The young bichir
  breathes, like a tadpole, by means of large external gills, projecting backwards on each side of
  the head; later these are replaced by the more efficiently protected internal gills.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The only surviving relative of the bichir is the <span class="sc">Reed-fish</span>
  of Old Calabar, which differs by its eel-like form and the absence of the hinder paired fins.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac"><span class="smaller">BY F. G. AFLALO, F.Z.S.</span></p>

  <p>Two prevalent errors with reference to sharks continually recur in England. The first is local,
  and has reference to the absence of "proper" sharks, whatever that may mean, from British waters.
  The second, of wider application, holds that all sharks are dangerous to man. When, some few years
  ago, the writer addressed a letter to the Times newspaper, warning yachting-men against summer
  bathing in deep water in Cornwall, a host of critics accused him of a tendency to pose as an
  alarmist, and insisted that he was confusing sharks with dog-fish. Apart from the fact that the
  distinction between the two groups is in some cases extremely slight&mdash;it does not even rely
  on size, for there are dog-fishes which attain to larger dimensions than the smallest
  sharks&mdash;these gentlemen were wholly in error, since four sharks at any rate are very common
  in Cornish seas, and even occur in lesser numbers on other parts of the British coasts. The
  largest of these, the great <span class="sc">Basking-shark</span> (of which a photograph, taken at
  Mevagissey, is given below), illustrates in its harmless person the fallacy of condemning all
  sharks as man-eaters, since in this, the largest of its race, we have an absolutely innocuous
  fish. From its habit of lying at the surface with the large back-fin erect, it is also known as
  the Sail-fish, while the equally appropriate name of Sun-fish sometimes causes confusion with
  other British fishes properly so called.</p>

  <p>A commoner British shark (in the limited space allotted, British species must be allowed prior
  claims) is the <span class="sc">Blue Shark</span>, small examples of which, weighing 30 or 40
  lbs., the writer has often killed with the rod at Mevagissey. When thus hooked, this fish has a
  curious and very trying habit of revolving rapidly in the water, scoring its own granulated skin
  with the line. The <span class="sc">Porbeagle-shark</span>, another Cornish species, is of thicker
  build than the last, and swims with far less graceful movements. It is a deep brown colour above,
  and its general outline may be likened to that of a torpedo. The <span
  class="sc">Fox-shark</span>, or <span class="sc">Thresher</span>, so often seen on hot summer days
  leaping out of water among the pilchard-shoals, is easily recognised, even at considerable
  distances, by the disproportionately long upper lobe of the tail-fin. This is the shark which
  attacks certain of the Whale Tribe. Many who stay at home find it agreeable to cast doubt on the
  story; but the writer has, in Australian seas, witnessed the sight of two of these sharks flinging
  themselves on the back of an apparently exhausted whale in such unmistakable circumstances that
  the only alternative (which the reader may accept, if preferred) is to suppose that they were all
  congenial playmates.</p>

  <p>Before specifying some general characters of this interesting group of predatory fishes, it may
  be as well briefly to summarise the <span class="sc">British Dog-fishes</span>; for the <span
  class="sc">Hammerhead-shark</span>, very common in southern seas, is so rare a visitor to Britain
  as to be negligible in an epitome of the group. The dog-fishes, then, which trouble fishermen are
  the <span class="sc">Smooth Hound</span> <span class="pagenum" id="page667"><span
  class="smaller">{667}</span></span>and <span class="sc">Rough Hound</span>, the <span
  class="sc">Nurse</span>, the <span class="sc">Picked Dog</span>, and the <span class="sc">Silver
  Dog</span>, or <span class="sc">Tope</span>. The <span class="sc">Nurse</span> and <span
  class="sc">Rough Hound</span> are spotted leopards of the sea, and the latter has a very curious
  property. If a fresh-caught "row-hound," as the fishermen pronounce the name, be put in a basket
  or boat's well with pollack and other fishes, the points of contact will be marked by
  discoloration of its neighbours. This is probably due to some acrid and bleaching secretion of the
  row-hound's skin, for which some economic use might possibly be found. The <span class="sc">Picked
  Dog</span>, or <span class="sc">Spur-dog</span>, has very sharp spines in front of both back-fins,
  and has therefore to be handled by the fishermen very cautiously, often punishing their hands
  badly when entangled at night in the nets. Of <span class="sc">Smooth Hounds</span> there are two
  species or varieties, between which there is some confusion, and in one at any rate there are
  interesting anatomical peculiarities in the unborn fish (like many other sharks and dog-fishes,
  the smooth hound bears living young instead of depositing eggs), any account of which would
  obviously be out of place in so short a description.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, then, the sharks are cartilaginous fishes, having the upper lobe of the
  tail larger than the lower, a shovel-shaped snout, and the crescent-shaped mouth beneath the head.
  Another peculiar feature of the group is the presence of breathing-spiracles behind the eyes;
  while the latter have a manner of blinking not found in other fishes. Of the teeth, which differ
  in structure from those of other kinds of fishes, there are several rows. The gill-openings are
  lateral, and usually number five, though one species has six and another seven. With the exception
  of the afore-mentioned <span class="sc">Basking-shark</span> and the <span class="sc">Port Jackson
  Shark</span>, which the writer met with in Australia, they are all more or less dangerous; and
  when of insufficient size to be harmful to man, do great damage among the lines and nets of the
  fishermen. Indeed, the <span class="pagenum" id="page668"><span
  class="smaller">{668}</span></span>late Matthias Dunn of Mevagissey seriously urged on the
  Admiralty to dynamite them in the interests of the fishing industry. Most of the sharks deposit
  their eggs in the curious oblong vessels known by those who pick up the disused cases on the
  foreshore as "purses"; and these attach themselves to rocks and stones by long tendrils that cling
  to every support. A number of species (the <span class="sc">Porbeagle</span> and <span
  class="sc">Tope</span> among British kinds), however, bring forth their young alive.</p>

  <p>Between the Sharks and Rays there is a curious and interesting link in the form of the <span
  class="sc">Monk-fish</span>, or <span class="sc">Angel-fish</span>, which is common on all sandy
  shores, and a frequent victim of the trawl. Such local names as Mongrel-skate and Shark-ray
  indicate a widespread acceptance of its intermediate position between the two groups under notice.
  Like some of the sharks already noticed, it produces living young, and its maximum size may be set
  down as at any rate over 7 feet. The writer measured and weighed one trawled in Bournemouth Bay
  during the summer of 1896. Its length was nearly 4&frac12; feet, and its weight rather less than 50 lbs.
  Like many of the rays, this species feeds to a great extent on flat-fishes.</p>

  <p>In outward form the monk-fish, though it is in reality more nearly allied to the sharks, brings
  us by an easy transition to the flattened <span class="sc">Rays</span>, with their long whip-like
  tails and pointed snouts. There are a dozen, or rather more if we count casual visitors, of these
  skates and rays in British seas, the largest being the great <span class="sc">Eagle-ray</span>,
  examples of which have been recorded of the enormous weight of 1,000 lbs. Many of the smaller
  kinds are studded with sharp spines, curved in some species, and the <span

  <p>Two interesting peculiarities of the rays deserve notice in concluding this chapter. The first
  is that their egg-purses, instead of attaching themselves with filaments to weeds and rocks, like
  those of the sharks, are provided with a sticky secretion which answers the same purpose of
  anchoring them in security from currents that would carry them out into deep, cold water. The
  second is the sexual difference in the teeth, which are pointed in the male and flat in the
  female. Whether this difference in the teeth (which may be likened to that between the bills of
  the male and female Huia-bird of New Zealand) indicates a corresponding difference in food, or, on
  the other hand, some co-operation between the sexes in procuring it, is an interesting question
  that our present slight knowledge of the habits of these fishes does not enable us to answer.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Finally, attention must be drawn to the remarkable transformation which the
  breast-fins and tail have undergone. The former have developed into powerful swimming-organs,
  locomotion being effected by their undulatory movements, instead of by similar movements of the
  whole body, or by side-to-side motions of the tail, as in other fishes. Whilst the latter, no
  longer used in swimming, has either been reduced to a mere vestige, as in the <span
  class="sc">Horned Ox-ray</span>, or has become developed into a long and tapering "whiplash,"
  provided with a poison-spine. In such cases the long tail is used to encircle prey, and at the
  same time to force the victim on to the deadly spine.</p>

  <p>This section of animals is often called a "sub-kingdom," and differs from back-boned animals in
  having the framework of the body outside. That is, instead of a skeleton, Crabs, Spiders,
  Centipedes, and Insects are protected either by a hard shelly casing, or by a tough skin, to which
  the muscles are attached; and this arrangement renders them much stronger and much less
  susceptible to injury, in proportion to their size, than vertebrate animals. They have cold blood,
  generally of a white colour; and their bodies and limbs are usually composed of a considerable
  number of separate joints.</p>

  different kinds of insects already known, while the total number of species now existing is
  estimated by different entomologists as from two to ten millions. It is, therefore, no
  exaggeration to say that every word of our brief account of the Insects represents from ten to
  twenty known species at least. The other classes of the group are also very numerous. Our account
  must necessarily be very short; the characters of the principal classes of the Jointed Animals are

  <p class="sp3">Jointed animals are generally provided with one pair of long jointed organs, called
  "antenn&aelig;," a naturalised word derived from the Latin, in which language <i>antenna</i> means a
  sail-yard. They are often called "feelers," and usually fulfil this function at least; but they
  are also frequently organs of smell, and sometimes probably of hearing and other senses. One
  peculiarity of the <span class="sc">Crab</span> and <span class="sc">Lobster</span> group is that
  they are generally furnished with two pairs instead of one pair of these organs.</p>

  <p>They are nearly all aquatic animals, by far the larger portion being marine, and they breathe
  with gills. They are provided with a hard calcareous or horny covering. The head is not separated
  from the trunk, as in insects; and they are provided with a number of jointed organs, usually
  classified as three pairs of jaws, three pairs of foot-jaws, and five pairs of legs in the more
  typical families; but in the smaller and more aberrant species the number is more variable. In
  their early stages they frequently pass through very extraordinary changes of form, but after
  assuming their adult shape they grow by casting their shells at intervals.</p>

  <p>We will now notice a few typical examples of the different groups of these creatures.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Brine-shrimp</span> is a little reddish creature about half an inch long,
  which prefers the concentrated solution of brine-pits to sea-water. It has eleven pairs of legs,
  and, notwithstanding its name, the front portion of its body is considerably broader and flatter
  in proportion than that of a real shrimp, the other half consisting of a jointed tail.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Barnacles</span> were formerly considered to be shell-fish, but are now
  usually classed with the crabs and lobsters, because, when they are young, they appear as freely
  swimming creatures, with one eye, two antenn&aelig;, and six pairs of jointed limbs. When they grow
  larger, they fix themselves to a rock or some other object by the head, and develop a shell,
  usually composed of several pieces. The commonest is the <span class="sc">Acorn-barnacle</span>,
  the white shell of which, measuring rather less than an inch across, swarms on rocks at the
  seaside. It is shaped like a limpet, but open at the top. The <span
  class="sc">Goose-barnacles</span> hang down by a stalk, and their jointed shells more resemble
  those of a mussel than that of a limpet, though they are composed of several pieces. Various
  species similar to both those mentioned are found on piers, rocks, the bottoms of ships, and even
  sometimes on the skin of whales.</p>

  <p>In dark cellars in the country, under loose bark, or under pieces of wood which have been left
  in the fields, we often see creeping about brown creatures about half an inch long, with jointed
  bodies and antenn&aelig;, and short jointed legs. They are called <span class="sc">Wood-lice</span>, and
  several species roll themselves up into a ball when alarmed. These creatures feed chiefly on
  decaying vegetable substances; and there is a larger marine species much like them, which is
  common in holes and crannies in the rocks on the seashore.</p>

  <p>There are other curious creatures, called <span class="sc">Whale-lice</span> and <span
  class="sc">Fish-lice</span>, which are parasitic in their habits. Some of these look like spiders,
  and one or two have enormously long legs; but others are of strange and almost indescribable
  forms, and sometimes without legs at all. One species, found on the sprat, has two long appendages
  at the end of its body not unlike a pair of compasses.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Shrimps</span> and <span class="sc">Prawns</span> are red when cooked, but
  when alive are very pretty semi-transparent objects, which may be seen swimming about through the
  glass of aquariums placed against the wall. Prawns are larger than shrimps, and have a strong
  <span class="pagenum" id="page672"><span class="smaller">{672}</span></span>serrated spine in
  front of the head. Shrimps and prawns, of which several kinds are found off the British coasts,
  generally prefer shallow water, with a sandy bottom. In most of these the first two pairs of feet
  are divided to form a pair of pincers at the extremity; but in such small creatures this is easily
  overlooked, unless special attention is directed to it. It is different with the <span
  class="sc">Lobsters</span> and <span class="sc">Crayfish</span>, which much resemble shrimps in
  form, but are very much larger, and armed with a pair of very large pincer-like claws, in addition
  to the other legs. Lobsters live in the sea, in holes in the rocks, into which they dart
  backwards, and there protect themselves with only the head and claws projecting at the opening,
  ready to face any intruder. Crayfish, which are smaller, live in holes in the banks of brooks and
  rivers. There are many species, some of large size and bright colours. The <span class="sc">Common
  Lobster</span> is black when living, but other species are red, blue, or variegated.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, if we pick up a whelk-shell on the beach, we shall find it inhabited, not by a
  mollusc, but by a crab, with its legs and claws wedged together, so as to fill the aperture
  completely&mdash;one claw, much larger than the other, resting in front; and if we pull it out, we
  shall find that, though the front of its body and the legs and claws are hard, like those of an
  ordinary crab, it has a long, soft, fleshy tail, absolutely defenceless and unprotected. Crabs
  belonging to this curious section are called <span class="sc">Hermit-crabs</span>, and protect
  themselves by taking possession of shells which they have either found empty or appropriated by
  the easy and economical process of devouring the owners. The few species found on the British
  coasts are all small, and more frequently noticed in whelk-shells than in any others; but tropical
  species attain to a considerable size, and may sometimes be found in shells measuring 3 or 4
  inches across at the opening.</p>

  <p>Crabs are distinguished from the lobsters by their compact form, and by having the short tail
  turned in under the body. There are a great number of species, differing much in size, shape, and
  appearance. One of the best known in England is the large <span class="sc">Edible Crab</span>,
  which may often be seen in fishmongers' shops, and, unlike the lobster, does not change much in
  colour when boiled. Every visitor to the seaside must have seen numbers of the little greenish
  <span class="sc">Shore-crabs</span>, running about on the sand, or over seaweed-covered rocks, at
  low tide. These small crabs are harmless, but large kinds are able to give a very severe pinch. It
  is related that when the great chemist Sir Humphry Davy was a boy he used to maintain that pain
  was no evil, until a large crab gripped his toe one day when he was bathing, after which he
  changed his opinion.</p>

  <p>Some crabs are smooth and shining, but others are covered with bosses, excrescences, and
  spines, which give them a very formidable appearance, and must be a useful protection against any
  enemies to whose attacks they are exposed. In many species one of the two great claws is always
  much larger than the other. Some have round bodies, others are oval or nearly square; some have
  short legs, and others very long ones. The species differ much in their habits; and in tropical
  countries there are land-crabs which live entirely on shore, and others which are amphibious, and
  climb cocoanut-trees to get at the nuts. As a general rule, however, crabs are carnivorous and
  marine, and play the part of sea-scavengers.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <span class="sc">King-crabs</span> differ very much from any now living in the
  British seas, but are generally considered to be allied to the Trilobites, an extinct family which
  appears to have been extremely numerous in very ancient seas. King-crabs are 2 or 3 feet long from
  the front of the body to the end of the tail. The front part of the body is entirely covered by a
  curved oval shield, while the hinder part of the body is much narrower, and armed at the sides
  with strong teeth directed backwards, and also with a long and strong spear, something like that
  of a sword-fish on a small scale, as long as the rest of the body. The few species known exhibit
  an instance of what is called "discontinuous distribution," since they are found only on the
  coasts of the Moluccas, East Indies, and the Southern United States and West Indies.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Scorpions, Spiders, and Mites.</span></p>

  <p>These creatures form a peculiar group in which there are only two principal divisions of the
  body, the head and thorax being fused into one mass, and the abdomen forming a separate division.
  In the Mites, however, the body forms a single round or oval mass, even the division between the
  thorax and the abdomen having disappeared. The members of the group have no antenn&aelig;, but two pairs
  of jaws and a pair of palpi, frequently very long, and armed with a pincer-like arrangement at the
  end, in which case they are called "foot-jaws." Except in some of the mites, which have only four
  or six, all the group have eight legs. They pass through no metamorphosis, but moult several times
  after quitting the egg before attaining their full growth. They have frequently several pairs of
  simple eyes, but no compound eyes like the large pair on the head of most insects.</p>

  <p>In the <span class="sc">Scorpions</span>, of which there is a considerable variety in different
  parts of the world, <span class="pagenum" id="page675"><span
  class="smaller">{675}</span></span>the united head and thorax are comparatively short; but the
  abdomen is very long, and divided into a broad half, consisting of seven segments, and a narrow
  tail of five very movable segments, besides a sharp, curved sting at the extremity. There are from
  three to six pairs of eyes on the head and thorax, and in front of the body projects a pair of
  very large pincer-bearing foot-jaws. Scorpions are generally of a yellowish or black colour; and
  the largest black scorpions of Africa and India sometimes measure as much as 9 inches in length.
  They are nocturnal creatures, hiding under stones, or in holes in the ground, or in crevices in
  walls during the day. They kill the insects and other small animals on which they feed with their
  stings, the sting of one of the large black scorpions, like that of the large tropical centipedes,
  being as painful and dangerous as that of a snake. There are a few small and comparatively
  harmless species found on the shores of the Mediterranean, but most of the scorpions inhabit
  warmer countries.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Jointed Spiders</span> are creatures 1 or 2 inches long, remarkable for
  having the head and the segments of the thorax separated from each other, so as to form distinct
  divisions of the body. They have rather long and very hairy legs, and only one pair of
  well-developed eyes, another pair being rudimentary. Some species are diurnal and others nocturnal
  in their habits. They feed on insects, and sometimes on small birds, etc., and can inflict a very
  painful bite. They are found in South-eastern Europe, Africa, Southern Asia, and from the Southern
  States of North America south to Chili and Argentina.</p>

  resembling scorpions in shape, but with no sting, and the abdomen not narrowed into a tail. They

  other small creatures, but not to injure the flies, only employing them as a convenient method of
  being conveyed from one place to another.</p>

      <p class="sp3">TREE TRAP-DOOR SPIDER OF BRAZIL.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Trap-door spiders are plentiful in some parts of Europe, but there is only one
      British representative of the family.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Whip-scorpions</span> are not unlike scorpions, and have large claws, but
  the front legs are very long, slender, and whip-like, and there is either no tail, or else a long,
  slender, whip-like one without a sting. They are inhabitants of warm countries, and, rightly or
  wrongly, are reputed to be venomous. Different species measure from 1 inch to 4 or 5 inches in
  length.</p>

  <p>The curious <span class="sc">Harvest-men</span> have two eyes, a small, compact, oval body,
  large pincers, and very long, slender legs, longer and more slender in proportion to their size
  than those of crane-flies, and equally liable to be broken off, if the owner is roughly handled.
  They feed on plant-lice and other small insects.</p>

  <p>We now come to the large and important group of <span class="sc">Spiders</span>, which more
  frequently attract attention in England than any others of the group. The abdomen is not usually
  divided into distinct segments, and is connected with the thorax by a short stalk. Spiders have
  strong, poisonous jaws, which make some of the larger species formidable even to man, and several
  pairs of eyes; while many possess an apparatus for spinning a strong silken web, in which they
  entangle their prey, consisting in England chiefly of flies and other winged insects.</p>

      <p class="sp3">HOUSE-SPIDER.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Exhibits the four pairs of legs characteristic of the group.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The largest known spiders are usually placed first in the series. These are the great <span
  class="sc">Bird-catching Spiders</span> of South America, some of which have bodies 3 inches long,
  and strong, hairy legs. These large spiders have now been proved not only to feed on insects, but
  occasionally on humming-birds, and even sometimes on larger birds, such as finches.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Trap-door Spiders</span> are allied, but smaller, perhaps averaging about
  an inch in length. They construct a silken gallery in the ground, with a round door, which they
  shut behind them when they enter. There is only one species in England, which does not form a
  trap-door, but a silken tube. If any insect settles on it, the spider clutches it from within,
  tears a hole in the tube, drags its prey inside, and then repairs the rent.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page677"><span class="smaller">{677}</span></span></div>

  <p>Different spiders have many curious methods of capturing their insect-prey. Some catch insects
  by running after them, and others by leaping on them, while those which spin webs are also very
  dissimilar in their habits and in their abodes. The brown <span class="sc">House-spiders</span>
  spin webs in any room left undisturbed long enough to allow them to construct them. On the other
  hand, the <span class="sc">Orb-spinners</span>, or <span class="sc">Garden-spiders</span>,
  construct elaborate webs out of doors. One of the most beautiful of these is the <span
  class="sc">Diadem-spider</span>, which is nearly an inch long, and of a green or reddish colour,
  with a white cross bordered with black on the back. The web is very regularly constructed, the
  principal threads radiating in all directions from a common centre, where the spider generally
  sits in fine weather, ready to rush out upon any insect which may become entangled in the web.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Gossamer-spiders</span> spin light webs, which are easily carried up into
  the air, and upon which the spiders are borne from one place to another. Sometimes on an autumn
  morning the air may be seen to be full of these floating webs, which also cover the grass and
  bushes where they have settled. The <span class="sc">Water-spiders</span>, again, construct a
  habitation of water-tight silk under water, like a diving-bell, and inflate it by carrying down
  bubbles of air from the surface, entangled in the hairs of the body.</p>

  <p>The nesting-habits of many spiders are very curious. The eggs are usually laid in a silken
  case, and the <span class="sc">Running-spiders</span> may often be seen with the egg-cases
  attached to the end of the body, as in the female cockroach.</p>

  <p>The males of many spiders are much smaller than the females, and are very liable to be devoured
  by their partners.</p>

  <p>Among the most curious of the group are the <span class="sc">Spiny Spiders</span>, strange,
  horny, semicircular <span class="pagenum" id="page678"><span
  class="smaller">{678}</span></span>creatures, studded with strong spines. They are allied to the
  Garden-spiders, but confined to the tropics.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Spotted Spider</span> is a very beautiful species, often seen among cases
  of mixed insects, etc., sent from India, It is black, with brown abdomen and numerous yellow
  spots, and about 1&frac12; inch long; the body is much longer than broad, and the legs are about twice as
  long as the body.</p>

  <p>Attempts have been made to turn spider-silk to commercial purposes, but the great difficulty is
  that spiders are so voracious and cannibalistic in their propensities that they cannot be kept in
  captivity, for they will kill and eat each other as long as there are any left, to the very last
  spider. The silk of some of the large tropical spiders is sometimes strong enough to cause a man
  much annoyance when riding through the woods, striking up against his face, and sometimes knocking
  off his hat.</p>

  <p>The last section includes the <span class="sc">Mites</span> and <span class="sc">Ticks</span>,
  most of which are small or microscopic. The whole body forms one round or oval mass, with
  scattered hairs, and eight legs, though most mites have only six legs when young, while the <span
  class="sc">Plant-mites</span> have only four. The largest mites are those called <span
  class="sc">Ticks</span>. There are one or two small British species which are sometimes
  sufficiently troublesome; but in many warm countries they are a far more serious nuisance, lurking
  on the herbage, and fixing their proboscis in the skin of any passing man or animal, and retaining
  their hold till they are gorged with blood, and allow themselves to drop off by their own
  weight.</p>

  <p>Among the smaller mites some species are parasitic on warm-blooded animals, causing itch,
  mange, and other diseases; while many infest insects, especially bumble-bees and dung-beetles.
  These are of considerable size for mites; and there are other bright scarlet species which are
  sometimes found on saw-flies, dragon-flies, etc. Many feed on decaying animal or vegetable matter,
  such as the <span class="sc">Cheese-mite</span> and the <span class="sc">Sugar-mite</span>, the
  former being a very familiar and interesting microscopic object; and others, again, are very
  destructive to plants, like the small scarlet mite known in greenhouses as the <span
  class="sc">Red Spider</span>.</p>

  <p>Among the plant-feeding mites are the four-legged <span class="sc">Gall-mites</span>, which
  produce galls or other excrescences on the plants which they infest.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Mites are probably almost as varied in their forms and habits and as interesting
  objects of study as insects or spiders; but the group is somewhat neglected by naturalists, owing
  to the small size of most of the species, and the consequent difficulty of collecting and
  preserving them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Centipedes and Millipedes.</span></p>

  <p>These are creatures with long, worm-like bodies, composed of a number of rings or segments,
  each provided with one or two pairs of legs. They have one pair of antenn&aelig;, like insects, but
  <span class="pagenum" id="page679"><span class="smaller">{679}</span></span>they pass through no
  metamorphoses, nor do they moult. Instead of this, they begin their existence, on quitting the
  egg, without legs, or with only three pairs of legs, and continue to add to the number of their
  segments and legs until they have attained their full growth. They are called Centipedes, or
  Hundred-legs, and Millipedes, or Thousand-legs; but in the majority of species the number of legs
  is considerably below 100, though in some few it may exceed 300.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Centipedes</span> have only one pair of legs attached to each segment of
  the body, and are carnivorous, being armed with a pair of strong mandibles, which are perforated
  poison-fangs. The British species are all small and harmless, but the bite of the large tropical
  centipedes is more painful and almost as dangerous as that of a snake. Centipedes are long, broad,
  flattened creatures, with about twenty-one pairs of legs, and sometimes measure more than a foot
  in length. A reddish centipede, belonging to an allied family, is common in England under stones
  and in loose mould. It has long antenn&aelig; and fifteen pairs of legs, and feeds chiefly on worms. It
  is about an inch long.</p>

      <p class="sp3">GIANT CENTIPEDE.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Most centipedes have considerably fewer than a hundred legs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Electric Centipedes</span> are much longer and more slender than the
  others in proportion to their length, with rather short antenn&aelig;, and short and very numerous legs.
  They are of a white or yellow colour, and 2 or 3 inches long. All are nocturnal in their habits,
  and feed on decaying animal or vegetable matter, and are fond of ripe fruit. They emit a pale
  phosphorescence, visible in the dark along the track over which they have crawled.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Millipedes</span> are not venomous, and feed chiefly on soft vegetable matter.
  Except the first three behind the head, which are provided with only one pair each, every segment
  bears two pairs instead of one pair of legs. The <span class="sc">Common Snake-millipede</span> is
  about an inch and a half long, and is brown, with yellow rings and ninety-nine pairs of short
  white legs. It is nearly as destructive as the Wire-worms, which it resembles in its habits, and
  may often be seen clinging to a partly eaten potato. Millipedes are able to roll themselves up
  into a spiral. Many foreign kinds grow to a much larger size, measuring nearly a foot in length.
  They are more frequently sent to Europe from foreign countries than centipedes, probably because
  they are sluggish, harmless creatures which do not bite.</p>

  <p>The members of one family of millipedes, called <span class="sc">Pill-millipedes</span>, are so
  similar to wood-lice <span class="pagenum" id="page680"><span
  class="smaller">{680}</span></span>in shape and appearance that they might easily be mistaken for
  them, and they exhibit the same habit of rolling themselves up into a ball. One species is not

  <p class="sp3">A curious genus, generally placed in a distinct class by itself, includes a few
  species which may be called <span class="sc">Slimy Millipedes</span>. The species are found in
  widely separated parts of the world, chiefly in the most southern regions, such as South America,
  South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, though one or two are known from Ceylon and the West
  Indies. They resemble slimy caterpillars, with conspicuous antenn&aelig;, and from thirteen to forty
  pairs of legs. The body is not distinctly divided into segments, and it exudes a very viscous
  slime, which acts like bird-lime in capturing the small insects which form at least a part of the
  food of these creatures, but which will not adhere to their own bodies. These creatures are found
  among decaying vegetable matter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Injurious Creatures.</span></p>

  <p class="sp5">We are sometimes inclined to complain of our English climate, but we have cause to
  congratulate ourselves that it is far less prolific of noxious creatures than many others. We have
  no venomous scorpions or centipedes, and are not obliged to shake such intruders out of our boots
  before we can venture to put them on. Since the country has been so well drained, we are very
  little troubled with gnats, which breed in standing water, and are equally troublesome in cold
  countries like Lapland, and warm countries like South America. Nevertheless, several very
  troublesome creatures, not native to this country, have taken up their abode with us permanently,
  and more care should perhaps be exercised in preventing the possible introduction of others. Among
  the most troublesome of our household insects are bugs, cockroaches, and house-ants, all of which
  have been introduced from abroad. Among field- and garden-pests, the American Blight (which
  destroys our apple- and pear-trees) and the Hessian Fly are probably invaders from abroad; but the
  latter does not seem to have committed great ravages in this country. Among pests which have not
  succeeded in establishing themselves here, but which we should be specially on our guard against,
  are the White Ants, which are found as far north as Bordeaux, and are terribly destructive to
  woodwork, wherever they are met with; the Gypsy-moth, very destructive on the Continent and in
  North America, but extinct as a British species, perhaps because there is something inimical to
  its constitution in our climate; and the Colorado Potato-beetle, which is only kept out of Europe
  by incessant vigilance. But apart from actually injurious insects, it is remarkable how many
  species which are common everywhere on the Continent are either absent from Britain, or are only
  met with in very restricted localities. Let us hope that we may long enjoy our comparative
  immunity from noxious insects in Britain.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>INSECTS.</i></p>

  <p>Insects are easily distinguished from the other jointed animals by many salient characters.
  They have one pair of antenn&aelig;, two large compound eyes, composed of a great number of facets, and
  sometimes one, two, or three simple eyes placed on the crown or front of the head. In its adult
  condition an insect is composed of three different parts, which can be most readily noticed in a
  wasp. There is the head, with the antenn&aelig; and mouth-parts; the thorax, to which one or two pairs
  of wings are attached above, and three pairs of legs below; and the abdomen. Insects breathe
  through openings, called "stigmata," in the sides of the thorax and abdomen. They never possess
  more than six legs in the perfect state, the abdominal legs present in caterpillars, etc.,
  disappearing in the adult condition. They generally pass through what is called a
  "metamorphosis,"&mdash;four different stages of life, called respectively egg; larva or
  caterpillar; pupa, nymph, or chrysalis; and imago, or perfect insect.</p>

  <p>Insects are divided into several large sections, of which the following seven are the most
  important, and many entomologists prefer to include all insects under them<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Sheath-winged Insects, or Beetles; Straight-winged Insects, or Earwigs, Cockroaches,
  Soothsayers, Stick-insects, Crickets, Grasshoppers, and Locusts; Nerve-winged or Lace-winged
  Insects, or Dragon-flies and their relatives; Stinging Four-winged Insects, or Ants, Bees and
  Wasps, and their allies; Scale-winged Insects, or Butterflies and Moths; Half-winged Insects, or
  Bugs and Frog-hoppers; Two-winged Insects, or Flies.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We proceed to notice these orders separately.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="fine">SHEATH-WINGED INSECTS, OR BEETLES.</span></p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">BY THE REV. THEODORE WOOD, F.E.S.</span></p>

  <p>Beetles are distinguished from most other insects by the fact that the front wings are not
  employed in flight, but are modified into horny sheaths, which cover and protect the lower pair
  while not in use. This arrangement, however, is also found in the Earwigs as well as in the
  so-called "Black-beetle" and its allies, and it is to be noted that the wing-cases of beetles lie
  evenly side by side together when the wings are folded, while the folding of the wings themselves
  is transverse as well as longitudinal. The number of species is very great, upwards of 100,000
  having already been described, of which about 3,400 have been taken in the British Islands.</p>

  <p>The order is again divided into several smaller groups, first among which stand the predaceous
  beetles of the land. Of these the common English <span class="sc">Tiger-beetle</span> is a
  familiar example. It is found on sandy and peaty heaths, and may be known at once by its bright
  green wing-cases, marked with white spots, and the metallic blue of the abdomen. The legs are
  coppery. It flies with great swiftness in the hot sunshine, taking to wing as readily as a
  blue-bottle fly, and feeds entirely upon other insects.</p>

  <p>Another representative of the group is rich golden green in colour, with coppery reflections.
  It is only an occasional visitor to Britain, but abounds in France and Germany, where it feeds
  upon the caterpillars of the famous Processionary Moth, and is largely instrumental in checking
  their ravages in the great oak forests.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The colouring of this insect is bright green with white markings and coppery
      legs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Familiar to almost all is the <span class="sc">Purple Ground-beetle</span>, so plentiful in
  gardens, and easily recognisable by the violet margin to the black <span class="pagenum"
  id="page682"><span class="smaller">{682}</span></span>wing-cases. It pours out an evil-smelling
  liquid from the end of the body when handled.</p>

  <p>The curious red-and-blue <span class="sc">Bombardier</span>, which, when interfered with,
  discharges a little puff of bluish-white smoke from the tip of the abdomen, accompanied by a
  distinct report, is also a member of this group. It is found under stones on river-banks, and also
  on the coast.</p>

  <p>Next come the predaceous beetles of the water, of which we have a well-known British
  representative in the <span class="sc">Great Brown Water-beetle</span>. This insect, which is
  plentiful in weedy ponds, swims by means of its hind limbs, which are modified into broad, flat
  oars, with a mechanical arrangement for "feathering" as they are drawn back after making each
  stroke. It flies by night, often travelling for a long distance from one pond to another, and
  regains the water by suddenly folding its wings and allowing itself to fall from a height. In the
  female insect the wing-cases are grooved for about two-thirds of their length.</p>

  <p>This beetle must not be confounded with the still larger <span class="sc">Black
  Water-Beetle</span>, which belongs to another group. This fine insect, which is not predaceous in
  the perfect state, is locally plentiful in ditches, and is in great request as an inmate of the
  freshwater aquarium. The hind limbs are not modified for swimming purposes.</p>

  <p>Next in order come the <span class="sc">Cocktails</span>, so called from their curious habit of
  turning up the end of the body when alarmed. To this group belong most of the tiny "flies" which
  cause such severe pain when they find their way into the eyes. Some species, however, attain to a
  considerable size, the well-known <span class="sc">Devil's Coach-Horse</span> being fully an inch
  in length. The great majority are scavengers, being found in carrion, manure, and decaying
  vegetable matter. A few, however, are lodgers in the nests of ants, by whom they appear to be
  regarded as pets and treated with the utmost kindness.</p>

  <p>The next group includes the curious insects popularly known as <span
  class="sc">Burying-Beetles</span>, which inter the bodies of small animals in the ground, scooping
  out the earth from underneath them by means of their broad and powerful heads, and shovelling it
  back when the carcases have sunk to a sufficient depth. The eggs are laid in the carrion thus
  buried. Most of these beetles are distinguished by broad blotches or bars of orange on the
  wing-cases, but one common British species is entirely black.</p>

  <p>Allied to these, and very similar in habits, are the <span class="sc">Flat
  Burying-Beetles</span>, of which there are about a dozen British species. In the best known of
  these the thorax is dull red in colour, and the black wing-cases are curiously wrinkled. Another
  species is reddish yellow in colour, with two round black spots on each wing-case. It is found on
  oak-trees, and feeds upon caterpillars.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page683"><span class="smaller">{683}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Leaf-horned Beetles</span> are distinguished by the fact that the terminal
  joints of the antenn&aelig; lie one upon another like the leaves of a book. In many cases they can be
  expanded at will into a broad fan-like club. The well-known <span class="sc">Stag-beetle</span> of
  Great Britain is a representative of this group. It is a somewhat local species, being plentiful
  in some parts of the country, and entirely unknown in others. The grub lives for several years in
  the trunks of elm-trees, feeding upon the solid wood. When fully grown, it buries itself in the
  earth, and constructs a large cocoon, in which it passes the chrysalis stage of its existence. The
  perfect beetle emerges in November, but remains within the cocoon until the following June. In the
  female the jaws are very much smaller than in the male, but are nevertheless more formidable as
  weapons. The insect may often be seen flying on warm summer evenings.</p>

      <p class="sp3">TWO BURYING-BEETLES.</p>
      <p class="sp0">These insects are about an inch in length; many are black, but others have
      orange-red bands on the wing-cases.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A still larger insect belonging to the same group is the <span class="sc">Hercules
  Beetle</span>, found in the West Indies and tropical America, a male of average size being nearly
  5 inches in length. In this beetle the thorax is prolonged into a horn, which is curved downwards,
  while the head is produced into a similar horn curved upwards, so that the two look like a pair of
  enormous jaws. It has been stated that these horns, both of which are furnished with tooth-like
  projections, are employed in sawing off the smaller branches of trees, the beetle grasping a bough
  firmly, and flying round and round in a circle, till the wood is completely cut through. This
  assertion, however, is totally unworthy of credit. An example of the beetle&mdash;evidently
  imported&mdash;was recently found crawling on a hedge near Biggleswade.</p>

  <p>One of the largest of all known beetles is <span class="sc">Drury's Goliath Beetle</span>, a
  native of the Gaboon, whose body is almost as big as the closed fist of a man. It appears to feed,
  while a grub, on the wood of decaying trees, and undergoes its transformation to the chrysalis
  state in an earthen cocoon, the peculiarity of which is that a thick belt, or ridge, runs round
  the middle. How this belt is formed is a mystery, as it lies upon the outside, while the grub
  necessarily constructs the cocoon from the inside. Several living examples of this beetle were
  exhibited in the summer of 1898 in the Insect-house of the Zoological Gardens in the Regent's
  Park, where they remained for five or six weeks, feeding on the flesh of melons. A photograph of
  this beetle will be found in the Coloured Plate.</p>

  <p>The common <span class="sc">Cockchafer</span> belongs to another division of the same group.
  This insect is extremely injurious, as the grub lives for three years or more underground, feeding
  on the roots of various cultivated plants. The perfect beetle appears in May and June, and is only
  too plentiful almost everywhere. A month or so later its place is taken by the <span
  class="sc">Summer Chafer</span>, or <span class="sc">June Bug</span>, which may often be seen
  flying in hundreds round the tops of <span class="pagenum" id="page684"><span
  class="smaller">{684}</span></span>low trees soon after sunset, while the smaller <span
  class="sc">Coch-y-bonddhu</span>&mdash;the "Cockerbundy" of the angler&mdash;often appears about
  the same time in hundreds of thousands. The beautiful <span class="sc">Rose-beetle</span>, too,
  with its bright golden-green wing-cases marked with wavy whitish lines, may often be seen sunning
  itself in roses or on the blossoms of pinks.</p>

      <p class="sp3">HERCULES BEETLE FLYING.</p>
      <p class="sp0">The most remarkable feature about this insect is its huge horn-like projection
      from the thorax, which is nearly as long as the rest of its body.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The famous <span class="sc">Egyptian Scarab&aelig;us</span> is also a member of this group. It is
  remarkable not only for the sacred character attributed to it by the ancient Egyptians, but also
  for its curious habit of rolling along balls of dung until it can find a soft spot in which to
  bury them. When the egg hatches, the grub feeds upon the dung, the quantity provided being exactly
  sufficient for its requirements. The common <span class="sc">Dor Beetle</span> of Great Britain is
  allied to this insect; it tunnels down to a depth of 14 or 15 inches beneath a patch of excrement,
  and lays its egg at the bottom of the burrow.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Skipjack Beetles</span>, parents of the well-known Wire- worms, which
  cause so much mischief by feeding upon the roots of cultivated crops, represent another group.
  These beetles owe their popular title to their singular method of regaining their feet when they
  happen to roll over upon their backs. Their bodies being very smooth and polished, and their legs
  very short, they cannot recover their footing in the ordinary manner. On the lower part of the
  body, however, is a highly elastic spine, known as <span class="pagenum" id="page685"><span
  class="smaller">{685}</span></span>the "mucro," which lies in a sheath. When the beetle falls
  over, it arches its body into the form of a bow, resting only upon the head and the extreme tip of
  the abdomen, removes the spine from its sheath, and then drives it sharply back again. The result
  is that the central part of the body strikes the ground with such force that the insect springs
  into the air to a height of 2 or 3 inches. Then, turning half over as it falls, it alights on its
  feet.</p>

      <p class="sp0">A very destructive insect which feeds on the leaves of trees. The larva devours
      the roots of plants, and is often so plentiful as to cause very serious mischief.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Fire-fly</span> of the tropics belongs to the same group. The luminosity
  of this insect proceeds from two different parts of the body, a brilliant yellowish-green light
  shining out through two transparent window-like spots on the thorax, while an orange glow is
  visible on the lower surface of the abdomen. The exact cause of the light is unknown, as is also
  the manner of its control by the insect.</p>

  <p>The same may be said of the common English <span class="sc">Glowworm</span>, in which the light
  proceeds from the lower surface of the hind part of the body. The male of this insect is winged;
  the female is grub-like in appearance and wingless. The grub itself, which may be found in autumn,
  is also luminous, and feeds upon snails.</p>

  <p>Another group includes a very large number of beetles of very varying character and appearance.
  Among these are the <span class="sc">Oil-beetles</span>, so called from their habit of exuding
  small drops of an oily liquid from the joints of their limbs when handled. The eggs are laid in
  batches of several thousand in holes in the ground, and the little long-legged grubs, on emerging,
  clamber up the stems of flowers, and hide themselves among the petals to await the coming of a
  bee. When one of the latter appears, two or three of the grubs cling to its hairy body, and are
  carried back to the nest, in which they live as parasites. One of these beetles may be seen
  commonly upon grassy banks in early spring.</p>

  <p>Allied to these insects is the <span class="sc">Blister-beetle</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Spanish Fly</span>, so well known from its use in medicine. It is a very handsome
  species, of a bright golden-green colour, occasionally found in Great Britain on the foliage of
  ash-trees. In many parts of Southern Europe it is extremely abundant.</p>

  <p>The beetles belonging to the large and important group of <span class="sc">Weevils</span> are
  characterised, as a rule, by the fact that the head is prolonged into a more or less long and
  slender snout, or "rostrum," at the end of which the jaws are situated. The number of species
  already known is above 20,000.</p>

  <p>One of the largest and most famous of these insects is the <span
  class="sc">Diamond-beetle</span> of Brazil, the scales from whose wing-cases are so frequently
  mounted as microscopic objects. When viewed through a good instrument under a powerful light, the
  beauty of these scales is simply indescribable. All that one can say of them is that they seem to
  be composed of diamonds, rubies, topazes, and emeralds massed together in rich profusion, while
  diamonds are transformed into rubies, rubies into topazes, and topazes into emeralds at every
  change of light.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Osier-weevil</span>, a black-and-white species about three-eighths of an
  inch long, is found on osiers in Great Britain, the grub boring galleries in the stems, and often
  causing considerable damage. The well-known <span class="sc">Corn-weevil</span> is still more
  destructive in granaries, the walls of which are often completely blackened by its crawling
  multitudes. The grub lives inside the grain, eating out the whole of the interior, and a single
  pair of the weevils are said to be capable of producing a family of more than 6,000 individuals in
  the course of a single season. The <span class="sc">Rice-weevil</span> is equally destructive to
  rice, and may be recognised by the two red spots on each wing-case.</p>

  <p>The famous "<span class="sc">Gru-gru</span>" of the West Indies, which is regarded as so great
  a dainty both by the negroes and by many of the white colonists, is the grub of the <span
  class="sc">Palm-weevil</span>. It lives in the stems of palm-trees, and also in those of
  sugar-canes, causing a great deal of mischief by its burrowings. When fully fed, it constructs a
  cocoon by tearing off strips of bark and weaving them neatly together. The <span
  class="sc">Sugar-weevil</span> is still more troublesome, feeding upon the juice of the
  sugar-cane, and affecting the entire plant in such a manner that sugar can no longer be
  manufactured from it.</p>

  <p>"Bad" nuts are also due to one of these insects, the common <span class="sc">Nut-weevil</span>.
  which introduces its egg into the kernel during the earlier stages of its development. When the
  grub hatches, it proceeds to devour the kernel, leaving a quantity of bad-flavoured "frass" behind
  it, while the shell is left untouched until the perfect insect emerges. An allied species attacks
  acorns in a similar manner.</p>

  <p>Among the finest and largest of all beetles are many of those belonging to the great Long-horn
  group, of which the common <span class="sc">British Musk-beetle</span> is a familiar example. This
  insect owes both its popular <span class="pagenum" id="page687"><span
  class="smaller">{687}</span></span>and scientific titles to its powerful odour, which perhaps
  resembles that of sweetbriar rather than musk, and can often be detected at a distance of twenty
  or thirty yards. The beetle, which is rich metallic green in colour, with long, slender antenn&aelig;,
  may be found in July sunning itself on the trunks or foliage of willow-trees. It varies
  considerably in size.</p>

  <p>Still more plentiful is the <span class="sc">Wasp-beetle</span>, with its black wing-cases
  banded with bright yellow. While flying, it may easily be mistaken for the insect whose name it
  bears. The grub lives in old posts, rails, hop-poles, etc., feeding upon the solid wood.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Timberman</span> is remarkable for the extreme length of the antenn&aelig;,
  which, in the male insect, are three or four times as long as the body, and trail out far behind
  it during flight. It is found, not uncommonly, in fir woods in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The beautiful <span class="sc">Harlequin Beetle</span> of tropical America is one of the
  largest members of the group, and is remarkable for the great length of the front legs as well as
  for the singular colouring of the wing-cases. It lives almost entirely in the trees, swinging
  itself from branch to branch somewhat after the manner of a spider-monkey. When it ventures into
  the air, it is greatly incommoded by the size of its limbs and the length of its antenn&aelig;, and
  seems to have but little power of directing its course.</p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;" class="sp0"> Among the group to which this insect belongs are
      many of the most brilliantly coloured British beetles.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Another great group of beetles is that of the <span class="sc">Plant-eaters</span>, many of
  which are exceedingly beautiful. The <span class="sc">Reed-beetles</span> of Britain, for example,
  are resplendent in crimson and green and purple and blue, while the metallic radiance of others
  has gained for them the title of <span class="sc">Golden Apples</span>.</p>

  <p>The notorious <span class="sc">Colorado Beetle</span> is a member of this group. It may be
  recognised at once by the five black streaks running down each of the yellow wing-cases. On the
  havoc which it causes among potato-plants in North America it is unnecessary to dilate. On a
  smaller scale, the <span class="sc">Turnip-flea</span> is very mischievous in Britain, perforating
  the leaves of turnip-plants, or&mdash;worse still&mdash;eating off the seed-leaves as soon as they
  appear above the surface of the ground. Of only too many of these exquisite beetles, in fact, it
  must be said that their beauty is only equalled by their destructiveness.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Ladybirds</span> include a very large number of species. Some of these,
  such as the common <span class="sc">Two-spot Ladybird</span>, are exceedingly variable, a long
  series being easily obtained in which no two specimens resemble one another. Both as grubs and as
  perfect insects they feed upon the "Green Fly" of the farmer, combining with the grubs of the
  Lace-wing and Hoverer Flies to keep its numbers within due limits.</p>

  <p>Almost equally common is the <span class="sc">Seven-spot Ladybird</span>, a considerably larger
  insect, with seven round black spots on its scarlet wing-cases, which may be seen on almost any
  grassy bank in spring. Both this and the preceding species sometimes visit the Kentish coast in
  vast swarms, the beach being reddened by their bodies for miles. The last immigration of this
  description took place in 1886, in the summer of which year the hops in East Kent were almost
  destroyed by blight, and the ladybirds made their way at once to the hop-fields and cleared them
  of the pest in a wonderfully short space of time. A much smaller species, known as the <span
  class="sc">Twenty-two Spot</span>, is yellow in colour and has eleven black spots on each
  wing-case. It is generally found crawling about on nettle-leaves in the early part of the
  summer.</p>

  <p>Allied to the Ladybirds are the very curious <span class="sc">Tortoise-beetles</span>. In these
  insects the wing-cases project to a considerable distance beyond the sides of the body, and the
  legs are so short that only the feet can be seen from above, so that the appearance is very much
  like <span class="pagenum" id="page688"><span class="smaller">{688}</span></span>that of a
  tortoise with the limbs partly withdrawn into the shell. Many different species are known, in some
  of which the wing-cases are streaked with brilliant metallic silver, which, however, fades away
  very shortly after death. The commonest of the British tortoise-beetles is found on thistles.</p>

  <p>Another very large group of beetles is represented by the <span
  class="sc">Cellar-beetle</span>, which is generally very common in old houses. This insect must
  not be confused with the so-called "Black-beetle," from which it may easily be distinguished by
  its deep black colour, its very much shorter feelers, and the curious point into which the end of
  its body is produced. It hides away in dark corners by day, and crawls slowly about by night.
  Related to it is the <span class="sc">Meal-worm</span>, so much in request for the food of
  cage-birds, which is usually very plentiful in granaries.</p>

  <p>Very different, in appearance, yet belonging to the same group, is the handsome <span
  class="sc">Cardinal Beetle</span>, a bright scarlet insect which is not uncommon in summer. It may
  sometimes be found lurking behind pieces of loose bark, and is also fond of resting upon the
  flowers of umbelliferous plants in the hot sunshine. A second species, which is not nearly so
  plentiful, may be distinguished by the fact that the head is entirely black.</p>

  <p>Still more curious is the <span class="sc">Rhipiphorus Beetle</span>, which is parasitic within
  the nests of wasps. Where the egg is laid, or how the grub first finds its way into the nest, no
  one has yet succeeded in discovering; but having made its entry, the insect proceeds to burrow
  into the body of a wasp-grub, and lives within it for several days, feeding upon its flesh
  meanwhile. After increasing considerably in size, it creeps out of the carcase of its victim and
  changes its skin, after which it resumes its interrupted meal, and continues to feed until the
  last vestige of the wasp-grub has been devoured. It then changes to a chrysalis in the cell, and
  the perfect insect appears a few days later. Oddly enough, the wasps appear to take no notice of
  its presence, and never attempt to molest it. The two sexes of this beetle are quite unlike one
  another, the male having the wing-cases yellow and the feelers heavily plumed, while the female is
  black, with the feelers only slightly toothed.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Most singular of all the insects belonging to this order, however, is the strange
  little <span class="sc">Stalk-eyed Beetle</span>, which spends the greater part of its life half
  buried in the body of a bee. In this insect the feelers are branched, somewhat like the
  antennules, or lesser feelers, of a lobster, and the eyes, which are comparatively few in number,
  are set at the ends of short foot-stalks. The male has very narrow wing-cases, but extremely large
  wings, which have a milky appearance during flight that can hardly be mistaken. The female has no
  wings at all, and in general aspect is nothing more than a grub. In early spring a great number of
  solitary bees are infested by this extraordinary parasite, which burrows into their bodies under
  cover of the projecting edges of the segments, and there remains feeding upon their internal
  juices for several weeks, with only just the tip of its tail protruding. When fully fed, it
  emerges from the body of its involuntary host, leaving a large round hole behind it, which
  frequently closes up and heals. In any case, strange to say, the ravages of the parasite appear to
  have but little effect upon the health of the bee.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac"><span class="smaller">BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.</span></p>

  <p>The insects of this order are less numerous in species than those of any other but the next,
  and are easily recognised. The fore wings are usually of a leathery consistency, and the hind
  wings are folded beneath them like a fan in the more typical families, though in the Earwigs and
  Cockroaches a somewhat different arrangement prevails. In the Earwigs, indeed, the wings are
  doubled back at the ends, and in the Cockroaches the wing-cases, or "tegmina," as they are
  technically called, overlap. As a rule these insects feed entirely on vegetable substances. The
  "Soothsayers" form an exception, being carnivorous, though they are not parasitic, like the
  Ichneumon-flies, but feed on fresh food; and several species of Earwigs, Cockroaches, and
  Crickets, especially those which are semi-domesticated, are omnivorous, and will eat animal as
  well as vegetable food. These insects have an imperfect metamorphosis&mdash;that is, there is no
  inactive pupa-state; but, the young, on emerging from the egg, already possess a recognisable
  resemblance to their full-grown parents, and their metamorphosis consists of a series of moults,
  before the last of which rudimentary wings appear in those species which ultimately acquire these
  appendages. A considerable number of species never have wings, a circumstance which frequently
  renders it difficult to determine whether a specimen is fully developed. The antenn&aelig; are usually
  long, and the joints distinctly separated, but are very rarely feathered. At the other end of the
  body we often find two long jointed organs, called "cerci." The jaws are always furnished with
  strong mandibles. Many Grasshoppers and Locusts have a curious arrangement on the shank of the
  front leg, consisting either of a round or an oval cavity on each side, closed by a membrane, or
  of two long parallel slits in front. These are considered to be organs of hearing. The largest
  known insects belong to this order; the proportion of large or moderate-sized species is
  considerable; and the smallest are probably considerably larger than the smallest members of any
  other group. They are not numerous in temperate climates; there are only about fifty British
  species, and most of the larger of these are either naturalised species, or merely casual visitors
  from abroad.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Earwigs</span> form the first family. Some are wingless, but most have
  very short wing-cases, under which very large wings, forming the most beautiful feature of these
  otherwise unattractive insects, are doubled and folded into a very small compass. Some of the
  smaller species fly readily; but others, such as the <span class="sc">Common Earwig</span>, though
  furnished with ample wings, are rarely seen to use them. The most conspicuous organ of the earwigs
  is the curious forceps at the extremity of the body, the use of which does not seem to be well
  made out, though it has been suggested that it is used for folding and unfolding the wings. The
  forceps differs very much in size and shape in different species; it is always larger in the male
  than in the female, and often differently shaped. In the common earwig the male forceps is
  flattened and contiguous at the base, and rounded and <span class="pagenum" id="page690"><span
  class="smaller">{690}</span></span>incurved at the extremity. There are two varieties, in one of
  which the forceps is twice as long as in the other; but intermediate gradations do not seem to be
  met with. In the female the forceps is narrow, nearly straight, and approximating. The earwig is a
  nocturnal insect, and hides itself during the day in large-headed flowers, like dahlias, to which
  it is very destructive, or in any convenient dark and narrow crevice, especially among decaying
  vegetable matter. It derives its name from its occasionally entering the human ear, but it may be
  easily driven out by dropping in a little olive oil. In most books it is denied that earwigs enter
  the ear at all, but it is, nevertheless, an undoubted fact; and the fanciful derivation that has
  been suggested of <i>earwing</i> in the place of <i>earwig</i> cannot be entertained respecting an
  insect which seldom shows its wings at all. It should be noted that the female earwig is said to
  tend her young very much as a hen tends her chickens&mdash;an uncommon habit in insects.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Common Cockroach</span> is too well known to need description. The
  individuals with half-developed wings are the perfect females; but there are other species in
  which the wings are fully developed in both sexes, others in which the male is winged and the
  female wingless, and others again in which both sexes are wingless. In warm countries and on
  ship-board cockroaches are far more troublesome than in cold climes; and the large brown ones,
  with a mark on the back of the thorax resembling a crown, and very broad wing-cases and wings, are
  called <span class="sc">Drummers</span> in the West Indies, from the loud noise they keep up
  during the night.</p>

  <p>Lady Burton has given an amusing account of her introduction to cockroaches abroad: "After two
  days we were given a very pleasant suite of rooms&mdash;bedroom, dining- and
  drawing-room&mdash;with wide windows overlooking the Tagus and a great part of Lisbon. These
  quarters were, however, not without drawbacks, for here occurred an incident which gave me a
  foretaste of the sort of thing I was to expect in Brazil. Our bedroom was a large whitewashed
  place; there were three holes in the wall, one at <span class="pagenum" id="page691"><span
  class="smaller">{691}</span></span>the bedside bristling with horns, and these were cockroaches
  some three inches long. The drawing-room was gorgeous with yellow satin, and the magnificent
  yellow curtains were sprinkled with these crawling things. The consequence was that I used to
  stand on a chair and scream. This annoyed Richard very much. 'A nice sort of traveller and
  companion <i>you</i> are going to make,' he said; 'I suppose you think you look very pretty and
  interesting standing on that chair and howling at those innocent creatures.' This hurt me so much
  that, without descending from the chair, I stopped screaming, and made a meditation like St. Simon
  Stylites on his pillar; and it was, 'That if I was going to live in a country always in contact
  with these and worse things, though I had a perfect horror of anything black and crawling, it
  would never do to go on like that.' So I got down, fetched a basin of water and a slipper, and in
  two hours by the watch I had knocked ninety-seven of them into it. It cured me. From that day I
  had no more fear of vermin and reptiles, which is just as well in a country where Nature is
  over-luxuriant. A little while after we changed our rooms we were succeeded by Lord and Lady
  Lytton, and, to my infinite delight, I heard the same screams coming from the same room a little
  while after. 'There,' I said in triumph, 'you see I am not the <i>only</i> woman who does not like
  cockroaches.'"</p>

  <p>The dimensions of the insects are not so much exaggerated; for I believe this story refers to
  the large reddish American cockroach, which is common in many English cities, although only in

  <p>The <span class="sc">Soothsayers</span>, or <span class="sc">Praying-insects</span>, are not
  British, though one or two species are found in the south of Europe. They have long fore legs, the
  shanks of which are set with a double row of long, curving, sabre-like spines, and when at rest
  they hold them up as if in the attitude of prayer; but they are really on the look-out for prey,
  and the long spines are admirably adapted for wounding or grasping the insects which form their
  food. They also fight fiercely among themselves, and it is no uncommon occurrence for a female to
  tear to pieces and devour her mate, either during or after their courtship. The soothsayers are
  often of a green colour, so as to match the grass and leaves among which they live, and thus
  conceal them from their prey.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Stick-insects</span>. or <span class="sc">Spectre-insects</span>, have
  some resemblance to the Soothsayers, but are exclusively vegetable-feeders, and have long,
  sprawling legs, or shorter ones, sometimes more or less lobate; but they never possess prehensile
  fore legs for seizing prey. The wing-cases are generally quite small; but some species have
  beautiful large green or pink wings, folded fan-wise, and covered by the stout front border of the
  wing. Many species are wingless, and of a grey or brown colour, which renders them scarcely
  distinguishable from dry bits of stick; and among these is the largest living insect known, a grey
  stick-like species from Borneo, measuring nearly 13 inches from head to tail. Other species have
  curious excrescences on the legs and body, which make them look like bits of wood overgrown with
  moss or lichen; while others possess large flat lobes growing from the legs and body, which cause
  them to be almost indistinguishable from green leaves; and, indeed, these insects are frequently
  called "Walking Leaves."</p>

  <p>With the <span class="sc">Crickets</span> we commence the last three families of the group,
  which are distinguished from the others by their power of leaping. The hind legs are very long,
  with very thick thighs, and generally a double row of strong teeth or spines on the shanks. The
  feet are generally three-jointed, and there is usually a long ovipositor in the females. There are
  very few true crickets in England, but three of these are very conspicuous species. The first is
  the <span class="sc">Mole-cricket</span>, a large light brown insect nearly 2 inches long, with
  broad, short front legs rather like those of a mole, which it uses in a similar way. Though common
  and destructive in fields and gardens, it is not often seen: but if water be thrown on the ground
  overnight, and a board laid over it, one or two mole-crickets are likely to be found underneath in
  the morning. The <span class="sc">House-cricket</span> resembles this insect in colour, but is not
  much more than half an inch long, and there is nothing remarkable in the structure of its legs. It
  is almost the only noisy insect found in English houses, and is very similar to the common
  cockroach in its habits, although free from the disagreeable smell which adds to the disgust the
  latter insect often inspires. The third species, the <span class="sc">Field-Cricket</span>, is a
  smooth black insect, larger and stouter than the house-cricket. It constructs burrows in grassy
  places, but is not now a very common species in England. In the last two species, and many others,
  there is a bare space on one of the wing-cases of the male, crossed by ribs in a manner varying
  according to the species, which helps to produce the loud chirping for which these insects are
  remarkable.</p>

  the <span class="sc">Great Green Grasshopper</span>, which is found leaping about among long grass
  and low bushes, especially in the south of England. It is about 2 inches in length. Among the
  foreign species of this rather extensive family, we may mention some green or reddish South
  American species, with a large round spot on the hind wings, not unlike those seen in the

  <p>The last family includes the <span class="sc">Short-horned Grasshoppers</span>, or <span
  class="sc">True Locusts</span>, so very destructive in many countries, though the real <span
  class="sc">Migratory Locusts</span> are only casual visitors to England, the native British
  species being all small insects, found among grass, and doing but little damage. The commonest of
  the Migratory Locusts visiting Britain is the <span class="sc">Red-legged Locust</span>, which
  expands from 2 to 4 inches, and has grey wing-cases varied with brown, pale green hind wings, and
  red hind shanks, with white black-tipped spines. Another species, the <span class="sc">Egyptian
  Locust</span>, more rarely met with, has brown fore wings, and grey hind wings, crossed by a broad
  blackish band. Two photographs are given on page <a href="#page693">693</a> of a specimen brought
  to England among vegetables in the spring of 1901. Many foreign locusts, large and small, have
  beautiful red or blue hind wings, and some of these are common on the Continent, though not in
  England; those found in Europe are comparatively small, measuring only 1 or 2 inches across the
  wing-cases; but some of the great South American locusts measure as much as 7 or 8 inches in
  expanse. However, some of the smaller species, such as the <span class="sc">Cyprian Locust</span>
  and the <span class="sc">Rocky Mountain Locust</span>, which measure less than 2 inches across the
  wing-cases, are much more destructive than the large species.</p>

  <p class="sp5">A real invasion of locusts is a terrible calamity, for the insects fly like birds,
  but in vast flocks, and devour every scrap of vegetation where they settle. Sometimes a flight,
  two or three miles broad, continues to fly steadily over the same spot for hours together.
  Sometimes flocks perish at sea, and are cast up on the beach in heaps like sand-hills, extending
  for a distance of forty or fifty miles. Nor are the young locusts less destructive before they
  acquire wings; for they march across a district in such numbers as to extinguish fires, fill up
  trenches, and overcome all similar obstacles placed in their way by sheer force of numbers; and it
  is well said of a visitation of locusts, "The land is as the Garden of Eden before them, and
  behind is a desolate wilderness."</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="fine">NERVE-WINGED OR LACE-WINGED INSECTS, OR DRAGON-FLIES AND THEIR
  RELATIVES.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3 ac"><span class="smaller">BY THE REV. THEODORE WOOD, F.E.S.</span></p>

  <p>The Nerve-winged Insects owe their title to the peculiar character of their wings, the horny
  veins which form the framework of those organs being multiplied and sub-divided to such an extent
  that they assume the appearance of exceedingly delicate network.</p>

  <p>These insects fall naturally into two great groups, in one of which the chrysalis, or pupa, is
  active, and continues to take food like the grub, while in the other it is passive and helpless,
  like that of a butterfly or a moth.</p>

  <p>Prominent among the members of the first division are the Dragon-flies, which owe their title
  partly to their extreme voracity, and partly to the fact that they feed entirely upon living
  insects, which they pursue through the air. They are exceedingly swift of wing, and may be seen
  hawking over ponds and streams on any fine day throughout the summer and early autumn.</p>

  <p>The earlier part of their lives is spent in the water, in which the eggs are laid by the parent
  insect. The grubs are usually of a dull grey or brownish-green colour, and are remarkable for a
  curious organ known as the "mask," which partly covers the lower surface of the head. This
  apparatus consists of two joints, which fold upon one another, but can be extended at will, the
  one farthest from the head terminating in a pair of large and powerful jaws. When the grub
  perceives an insect-victim, it swims cautiously beneath, and seizes it by means of these jaws. The
  "mask" is then folded, and the prisoner drawn down within reach of the mandibles, by means of
  which it is speedily devoured.</p>

  <div class="ac w34 fcenter sp2">
    <a href="images/i_695.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_695.jpg" alt="DRAGON-FLY."

    <div class="x-smaller sp1 m025 ac">
      <p><span class="fll"><i>Photo by W. P. Dando, F.Z.S.</i>]</span>&nbsp;<span class="flr"><span

      <p>DRAGON-FLY.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;" class="sp0"> These insects are often known as "Horse-stingers,"
      although they do not sting horses; in fact, they are perfectly harmless, except to insects
      smaller and weaker than themselves.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The method of swimming practised by the dragon-fly grub is also very curious. Through the
  centre of the body runs a longitudinal tube, terminating in a circular orifice, closed by means of
  five tightly fitting valves. These valves, which together form a sharp spike when closed, can be
  separated at will. When the insect wishes to swim, it fills the tube with water, and then squirts
  the contents forcibly out, the result being that it is driven swiftly forwards by the
  reaction.</p>

  <p>The pupa of the dragon-fly is very much like the grub, with the exception that the rudiments of
  the future wings may be seen on the back.</p>

  <p>About forty species of these insects are found in the British Islands, of which the <span
  class="sc">Great Dragon-fly</span> is a well-known example. The body is 3 inches in length, while
  the extended wings measure about 4 inches from tip to tip. In colour it is light rusty brown, with
  a few pale markings. The "<span class="sc">Horse-stinger</span>"&mdash;which is perfectly
  harmless, notwithstanding its popular title&mdash;is also common, and may be recognised at once by
  its flat dull yellow body, which becomes blue in the fully developed male. In the graceful and
  beautiful <span class="sc">Demoiselle</span> the male is deep blue, with black patches on the
  wings, while the female is entirely green.</p>

  <p>Allied to these insects is the <span class="sc">Common May-fly</span>, popularly supposed to
  live for one day only. As a matter of fact, however, it spends a couple of years in the grub and
  pupa states, inhabiting burrows in the banks of ponds and streams. These burrows are curved, and
  have <span class="pagenum" id="page696"><span class="smaller">{696}</span></span>two entrances,
  one above the other, so that the insect can pass in and out with perfect ease.</p>

  <p>The May-fly is also remarkable for the fact that the perfect insect changes its skin shortly
  after reaching maturity. Before this change takes place the female insect is the "Green Drake" of
  the angler; afterwards, the "Grey Drake."</p>

  <p>To this group belong also the <span class="sc">Termites</span>, or "White Ants," so exceedingly
  numerous in almost all the warmer parts of the world. These are social insects, living together in
  vast colonies, and making most wonderful nests, which consist of a vast and complicated series of
  chambers and passages, sheltered beneath a turreted dome of clay. In the centre is the "royal
  cell," inhabited by the "king" and "queen," as the perfect male and female are called. These are
  winged when first they leave the pupal shell. But after taking a single flight, they snap off
  their wings at the base, just as ants do; while for the rest of their lives they are absolute
  prisoners in the cell built around them by the workers.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this strange incarceration takes place, the body of the queen swells to a huge
  size, so that, to quote Professor Drummond, she becomes "a large, loathsome, cylindrical package,
  2 or 3 inches long, in shape like a sausage, and as white as a bolster." She now begins to deposit
  eggs at the rate of several thousands in a day, which are at once carried off by the workers, to
  whom is entrusted the entire care of the helpless young. These workers, which are exceedingly
  numerous, also enlarge the nest from time to time, and construct tunnels of clay up the trunks and
  along the branches of trees, through which they may convey to the nurseries in security the gums
  and decaying wood for the nutriment of the young.</p>

  <p>A fourth form of insect is also found in the termites' nest, known as the "Soldier." The head
  is much larger and the jaws are much longer and stronger than those of the worker, and the sole
  function appears to be to defend the nest when attacked. Both soldier and worker, apparently,
  proceed from the same eggs which produce the king and queen, the difference in development being
  probably due&mdash;as in the hive-bee&mdash;to the character of the food with which the young are
  supplied.</p>

      <p class="sp3">TERMITES AT WORK.</p>
      <p class="sp0">This shows one of the most destructive of wood-eating insects, nearly of the
      natural size.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a state of nature termites are undoubtedly beneficial. They are scavengers, in fact, whose
  duty it is to remove the dead and decaying wood which would otherwise encumber the ground for many
  years. But in civilised districts they are extremely mischievous, books, furniture, and all the
  woodwork of houses being often completely destroyed by them before their presence is even
  suspected.</p>

  <p>The second division of the order also forms two well-marked groups&mdash;namely, the
  Flat-winged Insects, in which the wings are fully spread, horizontally or obliquely, even in
  repose, and the Hairy-winged Insects, in which those organs can be folded longitudinally, like the
  joints of a fan.</p>

  <p>Of the former group, the <span class="sc">Ant-lion</span> of Southern Europe is a familiar
  example. The perfect insect is seldom seen, owing to its nocturnal habits. In appearance it is not
  unlike a small and delicately built dragon-fly, with a yellowish head, a black body, and
  transparent wings marbled with brownish spots. The larva, however, is terrestrial, and lives in a
  funnel-shaped pitfall which it scoops out in the sand, always working backwards in a spiral
  direction, and jerking out the sand with its broad head in an almost continuous shower. Having
  completed the excavation, it buries itself at the bottom with merely the tips of its jaws
  appearing above the surface, and there waits for ants or other small creatures to fall down the
  sloping sides, accelerating their descent, if need be, by flinging sand upon them. The size of the
  pit varies with that of the insect, the fully grown grub digging down to the depth of about 2
  inches, while the cavity is about 3 inches in diameter.</p>

  <p>The mouth of the ant-lion grub is very curiously constructed, the jaws lying in a groove on the
  inner margin of the mandibles, or jaws proper; so that while an insect is held prisoner by the
  latter, the former can be employed in sucking its juices. When the body of the victim has been
  completely drained, the empty skin is thrown out of the pit by a jerk of the head.</p>

  <p>The chrysalis, too, is remarkable for possessing jaws, by means of which it cuts its way <span
  class="pagenum" id="page699"><span class="smaller">{699}</span></span>out of the cocoon which it
  made, when a larva, by spinning grains of sand together with silken threads.</p>

  <p>In some South European and African insects allied to the ant-lions the hind wings are modified
  into extremely long and slender shafts, slightly expanded at the extremities. In an Indian species
  belonging to a related genus these wings are scarcely more than threads, and bear a superficial
  resemblance to the attenuated limbs of certain gnats. One group, of which a Japanese species is a
  well-known representative, is characterised by the long, slender, and clubbed antenn&aelig;.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Showing one year's reconstruction to nest, of which the photographer made a
      section.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Mantis-flies</span> are remarkable for the structure of the fore limbs,
  which are almost exactly similar in character to those of the praying-mantis. The upper segment of
  the leg is so lengthened as to look like an additional joint; the lower surface of the thigh is
  armed with a number of long, sharp spines; and the tibia, or lower part of the leg, folds closely
  down upon it, after the manner of the blade of a clasp-knife. These limbs are used for seizing, an
  insect which is once grasped being effectually prevented by the spines from breaking away.</p>

  <p>The larv&aelig; of these insects are parasitic in the nests of tree-wasps and spiders, and have the
  peculiarity of practically losing their limbs as they approach maturity; so that while at first
  they are free and active, they afterwards become almost as helpless as those of many beetles. One
  species is found in Southern Europe, the remainder being widely distributed over the hotter
  regions of the globe.</p>

  <p>Allied to the Mantis-flies are the curious <span class="sc">Snake-flies</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Camel-flies</span>. In these insects the head is very large, and is attached to the
  thorax, or central division of the body, by a long and distinct neck, which allows it great
  freedom of motion. The neck is usually raised and the head bent down, giving to the insect a
  remarkably snake-like appearance.</p>

  <p>These flies are predaceous in their habits, and the four British species may be found on the
  banks of ponds and small streams, where they can obtain insect-victims in plenty. The larv&aelig; live
  beneath the bark of trees, and wriggle about in a singularly serpentine fashion.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Remarkable for the curious structure of the end of the body.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Equally curious in a different way are the <span class="sc">Scorpion-flies</span>, in which the
  body is prolonged into a slender three-jointed process, the extremity of which, in the male, is
  furnished with a pair of curved forceps. In spite of their somewhat formidable appearance these
  insects are perfectly harmless. They are very plentiful almost everywhere, and may be found in
  numbers on any sunny summer morning resting on the herbage on hedge-banks, or running actively
  about on the leaves of low bushes. Like the Snake-flies, they are predaceous, feeding <span
  class="pagenum" id="page700"><span class="smaller">{700}</span></span>entirely upon other insects,
  and often attacking those which are bigger and apparently stronger than themselves. The eggs are
  laid underground, and the grubs, which are entirely subterranean in their habits, feed upon
  decomposing vegetable matter. When fully fed, they burrow still deeper into the ground, and there
  change into pup&aelig;, from which the perfect insects emerge about a fortnight later. In the common
  English species the body is shining black, and the legs are yellow, while the transparent wings
  are marked with brown spots, which generally form three broken transverse bands. The insect is
  about half an inch in length.</p>

  <p>Certain allied insects have very slender bodies and long legs, and might easily be mistaken for
  "daddy-long-legs" by any one who failed to notice the presence of two pairs of wings. A species
  found in Southern Europe is reddish yellow in colour, with a brown thorax and yellowish wings. It
  has a curious habit of suspending itself from a twig by its fore legs, and seizing any flying
  insect which may come within reach with the middle and hinder pairs.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The grub of this insect lives in small pits in sandy places, and feeds upon the
      ants, etc., which roll down the sloping sides.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Allied to the foregoing is the extraordinary little snow-insect, which makes its appearance in
  mid-winter, and may even be found crawling on the surface of snow. In general appearance it is not
  unlike a larval grasshopper, with very long, slender legs, and antenn&aelig; of about the same length as
  the body. There is also a well-developed beak. The wings are quite rudimentary in the female,
  while even in the male they are so short as to be perfectly useless for flight. The insect is
  remarkably active, nevertheless, and possesses the power of leaping, although the hinder thighs
  are not developed in any great degree. In colour it is metallic green, with the beak, antenn&aelig;,
  legs, wings, and ovipositor rusty red. It is not uncommon in the north of England and
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>Far more generally distributed is the <span class="sc">Lacewing-fly</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Golden-eye</span>, which may be seen almost anywhere on warm summer evenings flitting
  slowly to and fro in the twilight. During the daytime it may often be found resting upon fences,
  or sitting on the leaves of low <span class="pagenum" id="page701"><span
  class="smaller">{701}</span></span>plants. In colour it is pale green, with a peculiar milky
  appearance, and the eyes glow as though lighted by an inward fire. The wings are so closely and
  elaborately veined that they look like a piece of the most delicate lace-work. It is not advisable
  to handle the insect, for, although perfectly harmless, it possesses the power of pouring out from
  its body a liquid of the most horrible odour, which clings to the fingers in spite of repeated
  ablutions.</p>

  <p>The life-history of the lacewing-fly is very curious. When the maternal insect lays her eggs,
  she first deposits a drop of a highly glutinous fluid upon a leaf or slender twig, and then, with
  an upward jerk of her long body, draws it out into a slender thread. On contact with the air this
  thread immediately hardens, and just as she releases her hold the fly attaches a single egg to the
  tip. In this way 200 or 300 eggs are laid together in a little cluster, which looks just like a
  tiny patch of moss. In the earlier botanical manuals, indeed, it was actually named, figured, and
  described as a moss.</p>

      <p class="sp0">The largest British species measures about an inch and a half across the
      wings.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The grubs which hatch out from these eggs feed upon plant-lice, of which they devour vast
  numbers, draining the juices by means of their hollow jaws, and then fastening the empty skins on
  their own backs, as an American Indian might decorate himself with the scalps of his victims.
  Owing to this singular habit, the grub becomes perfectly unrecognisable after the first few days
  of its life, only the jaws and feet being visible beneath the pile of dry skins. When fully fed,
  it changes to the pupal condition in a silken cocoon, which it attaches to a leaf, and the perfect
  insect makes its appearance in the course of a few days.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Alder-flies</span>, in general appearance, are not unlike caddis-flies,
  but may easily be distinguished by the fact that the wings are not longitudinally folded while at
  rest. They are very abundant in the neighbourhood of ponds and small streams, where they may be
  seen flying slowly and heavily, or resting on low herbage or the foliage of trees and bushes. The
  female insect lays her eggs in clusters of 300 or 400 on the leaves of water-plants, and the
  little grubs make their way down into the water immediately on hatching out, where they creep
  about on the mud at the bottom in search of the tiny creatures on which they feed. When
  full-grown, they are about an inch in length. They then leave the water and bury themselves in the
  earth, where they change to pup&aelig;, the perfect insects emerging in June or July.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Caddis-flies</span>, of which there are many British representatives,
  belong to the Hairy-winged group. The larv&aelig; of these insects are entirely aquatic, and remind one
  of hermit-crabs, the front part of the body being clothed with horny armour, while the hinder part
  is entirely unprotected. In order to escape the attacks of predaceous insects these grubs
  construct cases round their bodies, which they drag about wherever they go. In one or two
  instances, however, the case is attached to the lower surface of a stone.</p>

  <p>The materials of which these cases are made vary in accordance with the species. In one group,
  for instance, they consist of pieces of twigs and leaves, cut into short lengths, and arranged
  side by side in such a manner as to form a spiral band. The larva of another kind uses entire
  leaves, gluing them firmly together and living between them. A third species employs grains of
  sand and tiny stones, which it arranges in the form of a cow's horn. Most curious of all, however,
  is the case of a caddis-fly which is made entirely of the shells of water-snails. As these shells
  are, as a rule, still tenanted by their owners, the snails may sometimes be seen attempting to
  crawl simultaneously in half a dozen different directions, while the grub is dragging them in a
  seventh.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page702"><span class="smaller">{702}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp4">All the grubs retain tight hold of their cases by means of a pincer-like organ at
  the end of the body. When fully fed, they close the aperture at each end of the tube, and assume
  the chrysalis state, the perfect insects emerging a few weeks later. Although the wings are large
  and broad, they fly very slowly, and never seem to take more than a short journey through the air.
  They may often be seen in numbers resting upon the herbage on the banks of streams and ponds, or
  crawling down into the water in order to deposit their eggs.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="fine">STINGING FOUR-WINGED INSECTS, OR ANTS, BEES AND WASPS, AND THEIR
  ALLIES</span></p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.</span></p>

  <p>The order of insects to which the Ants, Bees, and Wasps belong includes a very large number of
  species. All these are provided with four membranous wings, alike in consistency, and provided
  with comparatively few nervures. The wings are usually of small size, as compared with the
  dimensions of the insects, but are very powerful, owing to the fore and hind pair being connected
  together during flight by a series of little links; and the flight of the insects is usually very
  rapid. These insects pass through a perfect metamorphosis, the pupa being always inactive; the
  jaws are provided with mandibles, though a proboscis, or sucking-tube, is also present, and the
  abdomen of the female is armed with an ovipositor, or boring instrument, which is frequently
  modified into a powerful sting, used to deposit the eggs in their proper position. One peculiarity
  is that several species of ants, bees, and wasps live in large communities, in which the bulk of
  the inhabitants, on whom most of the work of the nest falls, are imperfectly developed and usually
  sterile females, called neuters, or workers. This arrangement is also met with in the White Ants,
  which belong to the order of Lace-winged Insects. Among both the Ants and White Ants the neuters
  are unprovided with wings; but these organs are present in the fully developed males and females,
  though soon cast.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Found on oak, and not unlike the foreign gall used for making ink.</p>

  <p>A great variety of other insects also belong to this order, such as Saw-flies, Gall-flies, and
  an immense number of parasitic species, generally called Ichneumon-flies, among which are some of
  the smallest insects known.</p>

  <p>This extensive order of insects is divided into two principal sections&mdash;those in which the
  ovipositor is used as a saw or an auger, and those in which it is modified into a sting. One of
  the most interesting sections of the Borers includes the <span class="sc">Saw-flies</span>, in
  which the boring instrument is modified into a pair of toothed saws, which are used for cutting
  incisions in leaves, or in the tender bark of twigs, in which to deposit the eggs. These flies
  have four transparent wings, sometimes stained with yellow or purple, and their bodies are
  moderately stout and obtuse, and generally black, red or yellow. The antenn&aelig; are very variable in
  form, and are sometimes knobbed at the end like those of a butterfly; sometimes they are formed of
  a number of long, slender joints; <span class="pagenum" id="page703"><span
  class="smaller">{703}</span></span>sometimes of only three&mdash;a moderately long basal one, a
  short middle one, and a long terminal one, composed of a number of joints united into one; and
  rarely, as in the case of the males of some small species about half an inch long which feed on
  fir and pine, the antenn&aelig; are feathered. The grubs are very like caterpillars, and are sometimes
  called "false caterpillars"; but a true caterpillar (except in one or two very rare exceptions
  among foreign species) has never more than sixteen legs, while these "false caterpillars" have
  more, often as many as twenty-two. They also resemble caterpillars in another way, for the pup&aelig;
  are enclosed in cocoons. One interesting Australian species, which feeds on gum-trees, proceeds
  from a black caterpillar with only six legs. The perfect insect has a blackish head and thorax,
  with three large yellow spots on the latter, yellowish antenn&aelig; and wings, and a green abdomen; it
  measures about an inch and a half across the wings, and has knobbed antenn&aelig;. An allied species,
  found in Tasmania, is said to tend its young larv&aelig;&mdash;an unusual habit, except among social
  insects like bees, wasps, and ants. Among the commonest and the most destructive saw-flies in
  England are those feeding upon the currant, gooseberry, and pear, of which there are several
  species, measuring about half an inch across the wings. The commonest flies which lay their eggs
  on the gooseberry and currant are yellow, with the head, antenn&aelig;, and three long spots on the back
  black, and the wings transparent, with black veins. The grubs are bluish green, with twenty legs,
  and numerous black dots; and several may often be seen on one leaf. The best-known of the <span
  class="sc">Pear Saw-flies</span> is black, with the wings transparent, except the veins; the grub
  is very like a slug, and is green or yellow, very slimy, with the front of the body much
  thickened.</p>

  <p>Next to these insects come the <span class="sc">Gall-flies</span>, most of which produce round
  galls on oaks; and in some species we meet with a wingless brood, living alternately with the
  winged broods, but at the roots of the trees instead of in the open air. The veining of the wings
  is reduced to one or two veins; the antenn&aelig; are rather long, and not angulated; and the abdomen is
  <span class="pagenum" id="page704"><span class="smaller">{704}</span></span>short, and constricted
  at the base. The flies seldom measure more than half an inch across the wings. Some galls are
  hard, like the one found on the Turkey oak, from which ink is made; while others are large and
  juicy, resembling cherries, or small apples, among which is the so-called apple of Sodom. Others,
  like the Bedeguar, which is found on roses, have a mossy appearance. The latter are produced by a
  small black saw-fly, with part of the legs, and, in the female, the base of the abdomen, red
  beneath.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Formidable in appearance, but quite harmless.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Some of the smaller gall-flies do not produce galls, but are parasitic on other insects; but
  galls are very liable to the parasitic attacks of other insects, especially to those of small
  brilliant metallic green four-winged flies, belonging to an allied family, with very few nervures,
  but with a black membranous spot on the front edge of the fore wings, and angulated antenn&aelig;. Many
  galls do not begin to grow until the larva is hatched and begins to eat.</p>

  <p>We now come to five or six families of parasitic species, popularly called <span
  class="sc">Ichneumon-flies</span>, and immensely numerous and varied. There are probably
  considerably over 2,000 species in England alone; but they are comparatively little known or
  studied. Some of these have beautifully delicate wings, fringed with long bristles, and are among
  the smallest insects known, being of quite microscopic dimensions. These are parasitic on the eggs
  of various insects, and some are aquatic. But the more typical ichneumon-flies are of larger size,
  often measuring more than an inch across the wings. Their bodies are usually black or yellow, and
  there is often an irregularly shaped space in the middle of the fore wing, where the veins of the
  wing converge. In these flies the ovipositor is very short; but in others it is of great length,
  especially in the case of the largest British insect of this group, which is parasitic on the
  larv&aelig; of the great black-and-yellow wood-wasp, of which we have already spoken. This parasite is
  as large as the wood-wasp, but much more slender; it is black, with red legs, and two white dots
  on each segment of the abdomen. The ovipositor, which looks like three black threads, is as long
  as the whole body.</p>

  <p>The numerous parasites of which we have spoken usually deposit their eggs in punctures in the
  bodies of caterpillars or other immature insects, which the grubs devour from within during the
  life of their victim, leaving it to die when they themselves have reached their full growth.</p>

  <p>Intermediate between the boring and stinging insects of this order comes the small family of
  the <span class="sc">Ruby-tailed Flies</span>. These are brilliantly coloured bronze-red, blue, or
  green metallic four-winged flies, with the thorax covered with large depressions, and the abdomen
  smooth, and usually composed, as seen from above, of one large, smooth joint, and one or two much
  smaller coarsely punctured ones beyond it, the last ending in a variable number of short teeth.
  They roll themselves up in a ball when alarmed, and are parasites, depositing their eggs in the
  nests of other insects. An entomologist once saw a ruby-tailed fly hurled to the ground by a
  mason-bee which had built her nest in a hole in a wall. The fly rolled herself up into a ball,
  when the bee bit off her wings, and then flew away. But as soon as she was gone the wingless fly
  stretched herself out again, and climbed up the wall to the bee's nest to deposit her eggs.</p>

      <p class="sp0">One of the largest British species of a very extensive group of parasitic
      insects.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The group of stinging insects begins with the <span class="sc">Ants</span>, which are probably
  the most intelligent animals now living in the world. Different species, however, differ very much
  in their manners and customs, and in the grade of civilisation to which they have attained. Some
  of the more industrious among them keep other insects as cattle, and even as pets; others harvest
  grain, while a few species cultivate grain for their own use; and others make large mushroom-beds
  of comminuted leaves, and thus do great harm to cultivated trees in many parts of tropical
  America. When the industrious ants are not too busy, they sometimes indulge in sports and
  pastimes. But there are some species which live in idle communities. Such ants are only energetic
  as marauders, and are so degraded that they cannot even feed themselves, and starve to death if
  they are deprived of the services of their black slaves, which have been carried off as pup&aelig; by
  the others in piratical raids, and brought up by other slaves, which do all the work in the nests
  of their captors.</p>

  <p>Quitting the Ants, we arrive at a rather extensive series of insects of moderate or
  considerable size, and with very spiny legs, called <span class="sc">Burrowing-wasps</span>. They
  are brightly coloured, active insects, and generally dig holes in the ground, which they provision
  with caterpillars, grasshoppers, or spiders, which they paralyse with their stings, and leave in a
  moribund condition to form the food of their progeny. They are generally winged in both sexes, but
  in one family the females are stout and very hairy, and look like large hairy ants, while the
  males are slender winged insects, very unlike their partners. In the burrowing-wasps the front of
  the thorax, or second division of the body, is usually transverse, and often narrow; but in the
  <span class="sc">True Wasps</span> it bends back to the wings. Among these latter it is only the
  small group of the <span class="sc">Social Wasps</span> which are gregarious, and among which we
  find workers as well as males and females. The largest of the British wasps is the <span
  class="sc">Hornet</span>; but there are several much larger species in the East Indies, some of
  which are black and yellow, like the Chinese <span class="sc">Mandarin-wasp</span>, the largest of
  all, which often measures 2 inches across the wings. Others are black, with one large reddish band
  on the abdomen. Their nests, which they construct of a kind of paper, are formed in a hole in the
  ground, in a hollow tree, or in a bush, or under the eaves of a house. A nest is commenced by a
  single female which has survived the winter, and is afterwards enlarged by the exertions of her
  progeny.</p>

  <p>The last group in this order are the <span class="sc">Bees</span>. They may generally be easily
  recognised by their shaggy bodies and legs. As with the Wasps, most species are solitary, or live
  in very small communities. Some few are smooth, <span class="pagenum" id="page706"><span
  class="smaller">{706}</span></span>and more or less metallic. A photograph of a large and
  beautiful South American species appears in the Coloured Plate. The largest British bees are the
  stout-bodied <span class="sc">Humble-bees</span>, or <span class="sc">Bumble-bees</span>, which
  are generally yellow, more or less banded with black, or else black with a red tail. They form a
  small nest of cells just beneath the surface of the ground in meadows. A common European species,
  not found in England, is the large black, violet-winged <span class="sc">Carpenter-bee</span>,
  which makes its nest in a gallery burrowed in a post, where there is a separate compartment for
  each grub.</p>

  <p>There are only a few species belonging to the <span class="sc">True Hive-bees</span> found in
  different parts of the world. They can always be distinguished from any of the <span
  class="sc">Solitary Bees</span>, some of which much resemble them, by having a single long, narrow
  cell, about four times as long as broad, running along the front edge of the fore wing. In the
  solitary bees the corresponding cell is much broader and shorter, rarely more than one and a half
  times as long as broad, and only occupying a small portion of the front edge of the wing.</p>

  <p>Hive-bees have always been looked upon with more interest than most other insects, both on
  account of the valuable products of honey and wax which they produce, and because of their
  remarkable habits. They are probably less intelligent than ants, but they are larger; and as all
  classes of their adult population are winged insects, and have been kept in a domesticated or
  semi-domesticated state for many centuries, they have lent themselves more readily to
  observation.</p>

  <p>The hive-bees live in very large communities, and in a state of nature they make their nests in
  hollow trees or in crevices of rocks, where they build their waxen cells, store their honey, and
  rear their young. There are three classes among them,&mdash;the queen-bee, the female and the
  mother of the hive; the male, or drone; and the neuter, or worker, which is really an imperfectly
  developed and usually sterile female. Like other insects, bees pass through a metamorphosis, which
  in their case is of the description called "complete," for the immature forms of the bee show no
  resemblance whatever to the winged insect which will finally be perfected. Every bee commences its
  life in the form of an egg. Each egg is laid by the queen-bee in a separate cell, and in a few
  days the egg hatches into a white footless maggot, which is carefully tended by the workers, and
  fed by them with a preparation secreted by the bees, which is carefully graduated, not only
  according to the age of the grub, but is differently constituted according to the sex and status
  of the bee; for it is well known that it is in the power of the workers to develop a young grub
  which would otherwise become a sterile worker into a perfect queen-bee, by placing it in a large
  cell, and rearing it on the same nourishing food which is supplied to those grubs which are
  intended to become perfect queens. When the grub is full-grown, it spins itself a small silken
  cocoon, and becomes a pupa, or nymph, as it is called. The pupa somewhat resembles a swathed
  mummy, for all the external portions of the future bee can be seen outlined in the hard casing
  which encloses it. As soon as it arrives at maturity, it makes its way out through the upper end,
  when the cell is at <span class="pagenum" id="page707"><span
  class="smaller">{707}</span></span>once prepared by the other bees for a fresh occupant. The newly
  born bee is at first moist, flabby, and pale-coloured; but in a few hours her skin dries and
  hardens, when she at once commences her life-long labours, at first tending the young bees and
  doing other necessary duties in the hive, and then, a fortnight later, going forth with her
  companions to collect honey and pollen in the meadows and gardens.</p>

  </div>

  <p>There is never room for more than one queen-bee in a hive; and the queens, which may be
  recognised by their longer bodies and shorter wings, have such a mortal hatred of each other that,
  whenever two of them meet, they will fight, if permitted, until one is killed. But in summer, when
  young bees are hatching daily in large numbers, and the hive is getting over-populated, the
  workers do not permit the queens to fight; and finally one of them (usually the old queen in the
  first instance) works herself up into a great flurry, and rushes out of the hive, attended by
  several hundred followers, to seek for fresh fields and pastures new. This is called "swarming";
  and a strong hive will often throw off as many as four or five swarms in the course of the summer.
  It is then the object of the bee-keeper to get the queen to enter a new hive, for otherwise the
  swarm may fly to a distance and be lost; but wherever the queen-bee takes up her abode, her
  companions will assemble round her, and at once commence the work of building combs and storing up
  honey.</p>

  <p>The drone, or male bee, is rather larger than the worker, and has a more obtuse body. He may be
  at once distinguished by his long thirteen-jointed antenn&aelig;, or feelers, for the antenn&aelig; are
  shorter and only twelve-jointed in the queen and worker. There are several hundred drones in a
  hive; but the queen only pairs once in her life, on the wing, and the ceremony is immediately
  followed by the death of the drone. The drones have no sting, for the sting of the female and
  worker is really a modified ovipositor, or egg-laying apparatus, analogous to the organ which is
  so conspicuous in many ichneumons and other insects belonging to the same order as the bees. In
  the autumn the unfortunate drones are all massacred or else driven forth from the hive by the
  workers, when they speedily perish. The workers are by far the most numerous of the inhabitants of
  a bee-hive; there may be many thousands of them, and their number appears to be only limited by
  the dimensions of the hive itself.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page708"><span class="smaller">{708}</span></span></div>

  <p>The ancients had observed something of the economy of bees, but many of their ideas on the
  subject were strangely fantastic. It was perhaps natural to suppose that the leader of the bees
  was a king rather than a queen; but it was also supposed that a swarm of bees could be obtained by
  killing an ox and leaving the carcase to rot. This notion appears to have originated in swarms of
  flies, more or less resembling bees, having been noticed flying round or near putrefying
  carcases.</p>

  <p>Among all the truly social insects&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> hive-bees, wasps, ants, and termites, or
  so-called white ants&mdash;we find that the bulk of the community consists of sterile females, and
  the number of fertile females is very small, even in those cases where more than one female is
  permitted to live in a nest, as among wasps.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Solitary Bees</span> are very numerous in species, and consist only of
  males and females. They do not live in communities, but each female constructs a dwelling for her
  own young. Many of them burrow in the ground, and they are so far gregarious that a large number
  of females will sometimes form their burrows near each other in the same bank. There are about two
  hundred different kinds of bees known to inhabit the British Isles. The solitary bees are very
  varied in their habits, and some of them are parasitic on other species.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The large <span class="sc">Carpenter-bees</span>, which form their nests in wood,
  are not British; but there are some small British species which make theirs in the interior of
  bramble-sticks. Some are very hairy; others are smooth, and look at first sight like small wasps,

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Butterflies</span> and <span class="sc">Moths</span> are easily distinguished
  from other insects by many very obvious characters, and a considerable number are remarkable for
  the beautiful and varied colours of their wings. These are, as it were, tiled with overlapping
  scales, attached to the membrane by a slender stem; hence their name, Scale-winged Insects. These
  scales differ very much in shape, sometimes being long and slender, and almost hair-like, while at
  other times they are widened at the extremity, like a battledore, or they may be short and broad,
  like a fan or a shovel. Different forms of scales are found on different parts of the wings of the
  same insect; and some forms of scale are peculiar to the male, as are usually the dense tufts of
  scales found on the fore wings of the Skipper Butterflies, and on the hind wings of the Chrysippus
  Butterfly. The varied colours of these scales are due partly to pigment, interposed between the
  extremely delicate double or triple tissues of which the scales are composed; or, more rarely, to
  the refraction of light from the surface of the scales themselves, or, as has recently been
  stated, to different coloured scales alternating so that the varying colours are visible at
  different angles, as in the metallic "shot" colour of the Purple Emperor Butterfly, and in various
  species found in South America and other countries. In the case of the Purple Emperor, and in many
  other butterflies, this "shot" colouring is confined to the males. Indeed, as a rule, female
  butterflies and moths are larger than the males, but far less brilliantly coloured than their
  mates. There are, however, many species in which the sexes differ little in size or colour; but it
  only rarely happens that the female is more brightly coloured than the male.</p>

  <p>The bodies of butterflies and moths, the legs, and often more or less of the base or borders of
  the wings are clothed with hair or hair-like scales. These insects have a long or short proboscis,
  through which they imbibe their food, which consists of the honey of flowers, the sap of trees, or
  moisture from the ground. Like other insects, they have six legs in the perfect state; but in some
  species either the front or hind pair becomes more or less rudimentary, especially in the

  <p>Butterflies and moths pass through four stages. The egg is laid by the female on some plant
  which will provide suitable nourishment for the caterpillar. A caterpillar, which is the next
  stage, is a jointed, worm-like creature with sixteen legs; those corresponding with the legs of
  the perfect insect are horny, and a pair is placed on each of the first three joints behind the
  head. The next four pairs, called "prolegs," are thick and fleshy, and a pair is placed under each
  of joints seven to ten (reckoning the head as joint one), the last joint of all being provided
  with a pair slightly differing from the others, and called "claspers." In many young caterpillars,
  however, and also in the full-grown caterpillars of a considerable number of moths (especially
  among those with slender <span class="pagenum" id="page710"><span
  class="smaller">{710}</span></span>bodies), one or more of the first three pairs of pro-legs may
  be rudimentary or absent, and the caterpillar walks by arching its back at every step, in a way
  that must be seen to be appreciated, though such caterpillars (popularly called Loopers, on
  account of the way they loop up their bodies in walking) are often very active, and cover the
  ground much more rapidly than one might imagine. Sometimes the claspers, or last pair of legs, are
  modified into tentacles, which, in the caterpillars of the Puss-moth and its allies, contain
  retractile whips, used as weapons of defence.</p>

  <p>Caterpillars are very voracious, and increase in size with great rapidity; and whenever their
  skin gets too tight, after splitting it, they slip it off (along with the lining of the stomach
  and intestines), and after a few hours' lethargy, necessary to recover from the debilitating
  effects of such a serious operation, and to give the new skin time to dry and harden, they begin
  to feed again as voraciously as ever. The number of these moults varies according to the species;
  when the caterpillar has attained its full growth, it enters upon the third stage of its life as a
  pupa, or chrysalis.</p>

  <p>A pupa means a doll, or swaddled baby, and is a very appropriate name for the dark-coloured
  object, cased in a horny skin, with no detached organs visible, except the sheath for the
  proboscis in some of the Hawk-moths, in which this organ is unusually long, but with the separate
  cases of the wings, legs, etc., of the future butterfly or moth plainly visible in the sutures on
  its surface. The pup&aelig; of some butterflies have more or less metallic colours; and to these only is
  the term "chrysalis" applicable.</p>

  <p>Some pup&aelig; are naked, and those of most butterflies are either suspended by the tail, or
  attached to a branch by a belt of silk round the body. Those of moths are generally formed either
  in an earthen cell under the surface of the ground, or else are enclosed in an oval case called a
  "cocoon," chiefly composed of silk, though sometimes moss or chips of wood are worked into it.
  Other pup&aelig; are found between leaves, or, in the case of caterpillars which feed in the wood of
  trees, or in the stems of plants, in the galleries where they have lived.</p>

  <p>When the perfect butterfly or moth is ready to emerge, the pupa splits, and the insect works
  its way to the open air. Its body is limp and heavy, and the wings are like little flaps of wet
  rag; but it discharges a quantity of superfluous fluid, generally of a red colour, and fixes
  itself on a branch, or other convenient foothold, where its wings can hang downwards. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page711"><span class="smaller">{711}</span></span>The expansion and
  contraction of the muscles pump air into the hollow tubes which form the framework of the wings;
  these rapidly expand to their full size, and become dry and firm at the same time. After this, the
  insect flies about with its companions, pairs, lays its eggs, and then dies, after enjoying its
  life for a period, varying according to the species and the season, from a few hours to several
  months.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We have not yet spoken of the feelers, or antenn&aelig;, of butterflies and moths. They
  are two long, jointed organs, nearly always knobbed at the end in butterflies, or at least the
  terminal joints are thicker than the rest. But in moths the antenn&aelig; are of different shapes, and
  generally end in a point. Sometimes they are simple and thread-like; sometimes they are thickest
  in the middle, and thinner at both ends, as in the Hawk-moths; and they are often comb-like,
  especially in the males, as in the Silk-moths.</p>

  <p>As already mentioned, butterflies may be distinguished from moths by their antenn&aelig; being
  thickened at the extremities. There are comparatively few species in Europe&mdash;only about three
  hundred, of which between sixty and seventy are met with in the British Islands; but in tropical
  countries they are much more numerous and varied. It is a mistake to suppose that butterflies are
  always bright-coloured insects, and moths the reverse; for though many butterflies are brightly
  coloured, others are very dingy. On the other hand, although it is equally true that many moths
  are dull-coloured, others, especially among those with slender bodies, or those which fly by day,
  are quite as brilliantly coloured as any butterflies.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Among the most conspicuous of the smaller European butterflies.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Butterflies are divided into several groups, the first of which includes the <span
  class="sc">Brush-footed Butterflies</span>, so called because the front pair of legs is converted
  into hairy paws, useless for walking, and only employed for toilet purposes. This is a very
  extensive group, including about half the butterflies known, and is divided into several smaller
  sections. The most interesting species among the <span class="sc">Danaids</span> is the <span
  class="sc">Monarch</span>, one of the largest and commonest butterflies found in North America. It
  is migratory in its habits, and has succeeded in acclimatising itself throughout the Pacific
  islands as far as Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the Canaries; and so many specimens
  have been taken recently in the south of England that it seems not unlikely to take up its
  residence there also. It is a tawny butterfly, not unlike the one represented on the preceding
  page, but much larger, measuring about 5 inches across the wings. The caterpillar is yellow, with
  transverse black bands, and a pair of long, black slender filaments near each extremity of the
  body. The pupa is pale green, with golden spots, and is suspended by the tail, as is the case with
  most of those of the Brush-footed Butterflies.</p>

  <p>The next group, the <span class="sc">Long-winged Butterflies</span>, includes a considerable
  number of species with long rounded wings, found in tropical and sub-tropical America. A species
  with black and transparent markings is shown on page <a href="#page710">710</a>, but many have
  wholly transparent wings, except for a narrow black or brown border.</p>

  <p>Turning to more familiar insects, there are several kinds of large or moderate-sized tawny
  butterflies, marked with black spots and lines, called <span class="sc">Fritillaries</span> in
  England. The caterpillars are spiny, and feed on violets and other low-growing plants. The
  photograph on page <a href="#page710">710</a> shows the <span class="sc">Diana Fritillary</span>,
  a large and handsome species, which is somewhat of a rarity in the Southern States of America; it
  measures 4 inches in expanse, and the sexes are very dissimilar. It is dark brown, with a broad
  orange border spotted with black in the male, and rows of more or less connected green or white
  spots in the female.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Angle-winged Butterflies</span> include several of the best known and most
  brightly coloured British species, such as the <span class="sc">Red Admiral</span>, a velvety
  black butterfly, with a transverse red band on the fore wings, and several white spots between
  this and the tip, the hind wings having a red border, spotted with black and blue. It measures
  about 2&frac12; inches across the wings, and is common in gardens and orchards in summer and autumn. The
  caterpillar, which feeds on nettle, is brown or black, with yellow stripes and spines. The <span
  class="sc">Tawny Admiral</span> is a North American butterfly, remarkable for its resemblance to
  the larger butterfly called the Monarch, of which we have already spoken. The Danaids and
  Long-winged Butterflies have tough integuments and a disagreeable odour, which more or less
  protects them from birds. Many other butterflies belonging to other families have a superficial
  resemblance to these, and are believed to share in their immunity. This phenomenon is technically
  called "mimicry." The caterpillar of the tawny admiral is grey and black, with curious spiny
  tufts.</p>

  <p>The group of the <span class="sc">Satyrs</span> contains a great variety of moderate-sized
  brown or tawny butterflies, usually with round spots centred with white towards the margins of the
  wings. Many species are common in meadows; others, which are dark brown or black, with red,
  white-centred marginal spots, are numerous in mountainous countries, and two species are found in
  the north of England and Scotland. The caterpillars of the Satyrs are usually smooth and green,
  with a forked tail, and the pup&aelig; are formed on the surface of the ground.</p>

  <p>The great <span class="sc">Blue Butterflies</span> of South America form another group of
  Brush-footed Butterflies.</p>

  <p>The second family is almost entirely American, and is only represented in England by a brown
  butterfly about an inch in expanse, called the <span class="sc">Duke of Burgundy
  Fritillary</span>. The <span class="pagenum" id="page715"><span

  <p>The third family is represented in Britain by three very distinct sections of rather small
  butterflies, the largest of which scarcely measures more than an inch and a half across the wings.
  These are the <span class="sc">Hair-streaks</span> (brown, with light lines on the under surface
  of the wings, and a short tail on the hind wings, except in the <span class="sc">Green
  Hair-streak</span>, so named from the green under surface of the wings); the small <span
  class="sc">Blue Butterflies</span>, which generally have brown females; and the <span
  class="sc">Coppers</span>, the only common species of which measures about an inch across the
  wings. The fore wings are bright coppery red, with dark brown spots and borders, and the hind
  wings are dark brown, with a coppery red border, spotted outside with black. The small copper
  butterfly and some of the blues are common in meadows and gardens.</p>

  <p>Many of the members of the fourth family are of a white or yellow colour, among which are the
  destructive <span class="sc">White Cabbage-butterflies</span>, three species of which are very
  common in England, where they may be seen in every garden throughout the summer. The photograph on
  page <a href="#page716">716</a> represents one of these at rest. A prettier species is the <span
  class="sc">Orange-tip</span>, which is common in spring. The underside of the hind wings is
  mottled with green; and there is a bright orange spot before the tip of the fore wing, both above
  and below. Some of the South American butterflies of this family much resemble the Long-winged
  Butterflies of the same country.</p>

  <p>The family of the <span class="sc">Swallow-tailed Butterflies</span> includes a considerable
  number of large and handsome species, but they are not numerous in Europe, and only one
  black-and-yellow species, measuring 3 inches across the wings, is found in England, where it is
  now almost confined to the fens of the south-eastern counties; its green caterpillar, with
  transverse black bands spotted with orange, feeds on carrot, fennel, and other similar plants. All
  the caterpillars of this family are remarkable for possessing a retractile fork on the neck; but
  the butterflies do not all possess the long appendage to the hind wings which has given some of
  them the name of Swallow-tails. Thus it is wanting in most of the great <span
  class="sc">Bird-winged Butterflies</span> of the Eastern Islands, one of which, the <span
  class="sc">Cr&#x0153;sus Butterfly</span>, is represented in the Coloured Plate. The great
  difference between the sexes is <span class="pagenum" id="page716"><span
  class="smaller">{716}</span></span>well worth noting. The female is considerably larger than the
  male, but in the coloured figure the former has been reduced, owing to the exigencies of space.

  <p>"One day about the beginning of January, I found a beautiful shrub with large white leafy
  bracts and yellow flowers, a species of Muss&aelig;nda, and saw one of these noble insects hovering over
  it, but it was too quick for me, and flew away. The next day I went again to the same shrub and
  succeeded in catching a female, and the day after a fine male. I found it to be as I had expected,
  a perfectly new and most magnificent species, and one of the most gorgeously coloured butterflies
  in the world. Fine specimens of the male are more than seven inches across the wings, which are
  velvety black and fiery orange, the latter colour replacing the green of the allied species. The
  beauty and brilliancy of this insect are indescribable, and none but a naturalist can understand
  the intense excitement I experienced when I at length captured it. On taking it out of my net and
  opening the glorious wings, my heart began to beat violently, the blood rushed to my head, and I
  felt much more like fainting than I have done when in apprehension of immediate death. I had a
  headache the rest of the day, so great was the excitement produced by what will appear to most
  people a very inadequate cause."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <span class="sc">Skippers</span>, the last family of butterflies, are
  comparatively stout-bodied insects, with the antenn&aelig; widely apart at the base, and sometimes
  forked at the tip. They are not numerous in Europe; the prettiest of the British species is
  perhaps the <span class="sc">Pearl-skipper</span>, which measures rather more than an inch across
  its brown and tawny wings; the under surface of the hind wings is green, and marked with several
  clear white spots.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Moths.</span></p>

  <p>Moths are much more numerous than butterflies, and there are about 2,000 different kinds found
  in the British Islands alone. Consequently we are able to notice only a few.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Hawk-moths</span> have long, pointed <span class="pagenum"
  id="page717"><span class="smaller">{717}</span></span>wings, thick, tapering bodies, and the
  antenn&aelig; thickest in the middle. The pink, greenish-striped <span class="sc">Elephant
  Hawk-moth</span> (see page <a href="#page718">718</a>) is a comparatively small species. The
  specimens measure about 2&frac12; inches across the wings. Some species are much larger. The <span
  class="sc">Death's-head Hawk-moth</span>, whose caterpillar feeds on potato-leaves, is 5 or 6
  inches in expanse; and some of the South American species measure as much as 9 inches. The
  caterpillars of the hawk-moths are generally green, often with oblique lines of a different colour
  on the sides. They are not hairy, though the skin is sometimes rough, and there is a fleshy
  appendage, called a "horn," on the back, just before the extremity of the body. The brown pup&aelig; are
  found in cells in the ground.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Chinese Mulberry-silkworm</span>, which produces most of the silk of
  commerce, is a smooth, whitish caterpillar, about 2 inches long, with a horn. It is often reared
  in England on lettuce. The moth is a sluggish, stout-bodied insect. It is whitish, with two dusky
  stripes on the fore wings. The pupa is enclosed in an oval whitish or yellow cocoon of pure
  silk.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Emperor-moths</span>, of which there is only one species in England,
  likewise spin large cocoons, sometimes used for commercial purposes. The caterpillars are
  generally more or less spiny or tufted. Some of the moths have long tails on the hind wings, like
  swallow-tailed butterflies, and there are several species in South Europe, South Africa, the East
  Indies, and North America of a beautiful sea-green colour. It will be noticed that the specimens
  represented on page 718 have the tails a little broken, which is a very common accident with
  swallow-tailed butterflies and moths. We may also notice the round <span class="pagenum"
  id="page718"><span class="smaller">{718}</span></span>or crescent-shaped spots in the middle of
  the wings of some of the moths represented on this page and the next. These are very
  characteristic of the emperor-moths, and there is often a transparent spot in the centre of the
  concentric markings. Two other North American species of this family are shown in the photographs
  on page <a href="#page719">719</a>, rather under natural size. The second of these, the <span
  class="sc">Cecropia Moth</span>, is represented with its cocoon. This moth has occasionally been
  captured in England, having been introduced either accidentally or by design. A year or two ago a
  specimen was brought to the Natural History Museum at South Kensington which had been caught in
  the street close by. During the summer many foreign butterflies and moths may be seen alive in the
  Insect-house at the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, and several of the photographs given in
  these pages were taken from specimens living there in the summer of 1901. The largest of the
  emperor-moths is the great <span class="sc">Atlas Moth</span> of North India, the largest of all
  known butterflies or moths, which occasionally measures almost a foot across its reddish-tawny
  wings.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Eggars</span> form another allied family, also with tufted caterpillars,
  but with the central eye of the wings absent, or reduced to a small black spot. A set of
  remarkable photographs, representing the eggs, caterpillars, cocoons and sections of cocoons, and
  the moths of a large and handsome species&mdash;the <span class="sc">Cypress-moth</span> of
  Smyrna&mdash;appears on pages 720 and <a href="#page721">721</a>. We have received the following
  account of their habits from Mr. Mavroyeni, to whom we are indebted for the photographs: "In the
  month of July they start weaving their cocoons, in which they remain for seventeen days. A couple
  of weeks after the moths have emerged from their cocoons and laid their eggs, the eggs hatch, and
  the young caterpillars run up the tree, and feed from the end of August, during autumn, winter,
  and spring." We believe that the cocoons of this species are prepared for use as silk in
  Greece.</p>

  <p>Among other kinds, we may notice the bright-coloured <span class="sc">Tiger-moths</span>, with
  their black and cream-coloured fore wings and red-and-black hind wings, which frequent gardens,
  and are reared from reddish-brown caterpillars with long hair. These are stout-bodied moths; and
  there are other moths, with brown fore wings and whitish hind wings, which fly to candles, or buzz
  over flowers in the evening. These are called <span class="sc">Owl-moths</span>; but there are
  larger and handsomer members <span class="pagenum" id="page720"><span
  class="smaller">{720}</span></span>of the same family, called <span class="sc">Yellow
  Underwings</span>, measuring nearly 2 inches across the wings, and likely to be flushed in
  strawberry-beds or hay-fields. They have brown fore wings, and bright yellow hind wings, with a
  black border. The <span class="sc">Red-underwing Moth</span> is about 3 inches in expanse, and has
  greyish-brown fore wings, and red hind wings, with a black central band; it is often seen flying
  about willow-trees in the afternoon, or resting on tree-trunks, when the bright-coloured hind
  wings are quite concealed.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Looper-moths</span> are those produced from caterpillars which have only
  ten legs instead of sixteen, as already explained. Most have slender bodies of moderate length,
  and broad and rather brightly coloured wings, green, russet-brown, yellow, etc. Some, measuring
  about an inch in expanse, are called <span class="sc">Carpet-moths</span>, from the zigzag
  patterns on the fore wings, which are generally black and white, or brown and white, and sometimes
  green. The <span class="sc">Yellow-shell</span>, a yellow moth, with some zigzag brown and whitish
  lines across the wings, which expand about an inch, is common in hedges and bushes. The white,
  black-and-yellow-spotted <span class="sc">Gooseberry-moth</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Magpie-moth</span>, so common in gardens, is also one of the Loopers.</p>

  <p>Among the smaller moths are the <span class="sc">Pearl-moths</span>, with long slender bodies,
  wings longer than broad, and often with a pearly lustre, one or two species of which are common
  among nettles. We may also mention the <span class="sc">Snout-moth</span>, a brown slender-bodied
  moth, with a pointed beak projecting in front of the head, likewise a common insect among nettles.
  The <span class="sc">Grass-moths</span> are small moths, with narrow whitish fore wings, and broad
  brownish hind wings, which they wrap round their bodies when at rest. They are common in every
  field and meadow. The <span class="sc">Bell-moths</span> have broad truncated fore wings, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page721"><span class="smaller">{721}</span></span>and rounded hind wings. A
  species belonging to this family, with green fore wings and brown hind wings, may be shaken from
  every oak-tree in summer, and at the same time numbers of its little green caterpillars will drop
  themselves down, and remain swinging at the end of a thread, till they think that the danger is
  past, when they climb up again.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Clothes-moths</span>, familiar to everybody, are representatives of an
  enormous family of small moths, comprising nearly two-thirds of the British species, but only a
  few live in houses. Most have narrow wings with long fringes, and many feed in tortuous galleries
  which they eat in the substance of leaves. Some are among the smallest moths known.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">White Plume-moth</span>, which may be noticed floating about in weedy
  places like a piece of thistle-down, is a representative of a small family in which the fore wings
  are divided into three separate feathers, and the hind wings into two. The other species are
  brown, and smaller. When at rest, they look like small daddy-long-legs.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <span class="sc">Twenty-plume Moth</span> is a yellowish-grey species, less

  <p>We have now completed a rapid survey of the principal groups of Butterflies and Moths, and may
  fittingly conclude this part of our subject by giving a short account of the history of <span
  class="sc">Silkworms</span>&mdash;insects which far surpass all other butterflies and moths in
  their importance to mankind, on account of the valuable product which is obtained from their
  cocoons. The industry has been carried on from time immemorial in China; and many old Chinese
  works contain interesting particulars, especially relating to the rearing of silkworms by the
  queens and their ladies, for silk was probably a royal monopoly in old times. These Chinese
  records date back to about 2200 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, when the silk industry was
  already flourishing; but, according to the usually received tradition, silkworms were first reared
  during the reign of the Emperor Hwang-t&eacute; (2640 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>) by his queen.
  The following extracts from the "Le-he Book of Ceremonies," written between 204 <span
  class="smaller">B.C.</span> and 135 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and quoted by Horsfield and
  Moore in their "Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the East India <span class="pagenum"

  <p>"In the first month of spring orders were issued to the forester not to cut down the
  mulberry-trees; and when the cooing doves were observed fluttering with their wings, and the
  crested jays alighting upon the mulberry-trees, people were to prepare the trays and frames for
  the purpose of rearing the silkworms.</p>

  <p>"In the spring season, when the empress and her ladies had fasted, they proceeded to the east,
  and personally engaged in picking the mulberry-leaves. On this occasion the married and single
  ladies were forbidden to wear their ornaments, and the usual employments of females were lessened,
  in order to encourage attention to the silkworms. When the rearing of the silkworms was completed,
  the cocoons were divided (for reeling) and the silk weighed (for weaving), each person being
  rewarded according to her labour, in order to provide dresses for the celestial and ancestorial
  sacrifices. In all this none dared indulge in indolence.</p>

  <p>"In ancient times the emperor and his princes had a public mulberry garden and a silkworm
  establishment erected near some river. On the morning of the first day of the third month of
  spring, the sovereign, wearing a leather cap and a plain garment, ascertained by lot the chief of
  his three queens, with the most honourable amongst his concubines, and caused them to attend to
  the rearing of the silkworms in the above-named establishment. They then brought the eggs of the
  worms, and washed them in the river above alluded to, after which they picked the mulberry-leaves
  in the public garden, and aired and dried them, in order to feed the worms.</p>

  <p>"When the season was over, the royal concubines, having completed the business of rearing the
  silkworms, brought the cocoons to show them to the prince, when he presented the cocoons again to
  his consort, whereupon his consort said, 'This is the material of which your highness's robes are
  to be formed.' Having said which, she covered herself with her robe, and received the cocoons. On
  this occasion the ladies of the court were honoured with the present of a sheep. This was the mode
  in which the presentation of the cocoons was anciently conducted."</p>

  <p class="sp4">In the reign of Justinian eggs of the Chinese mulberry-silkworm were smuggled into
  Europe by two monks, and the culture of silk rapidly spread through Southern Europe, where it has
  continued to form a staple industry ever since. In the Peloponnesus especially such large
  plantations of mulberry-trees were grown for the purpose of rearing silkworms as to give the
  peninsula its modern name of Morea. Silk is obtained in different parts of the world from the
  cocoons of various other moths, chiefly belonging to the group of Emperor-moths; but these
  products are only of local importance, and are not likely to compete with the
  mulberry-silkworm.</p>

      <p class="sp3">JUNIPER-BUG.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Some species of this family are carnivorous as well as herbivorous.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The order including the Bugs and Frog-hoppers is divided into two sub-orders. There are also
  one or two small groups, sometimes treated as separate orders, and sometimes regarded as aberrant
  sections of the order, to which we shall allude later.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">True Bugs</span> have their fore wings of a horny texture, but generally
  overlapping, and the extremities form a transparent membrane, resembling that of the hind wings.
  They have a long sucking-proboscis curved down beneath their bodies, and their antenn&aelig; usually
  consist of only four or five long joints. Most are vegetable-feeders, but some species feed on the
  juices of other insects, while a few attack warm-blooded animals, either casually or
  habitually.</p>

  <p>The first family includes the <span class="sc">Shield-bugs</span>. These derive their name from
  the unusual development of a part of the thorax called the "scutellum." In most insects it is only
  a small plate of no great importance, attached to the end of the thorax; but in the Shield-bugs it
  forms a great solid arch, covering the whole of the wings, and protecting them as the wing-cases
  protect the wings of beetles. There are only a few small species in England, but a great number of
  beautiful species inhabit warm countries, some of a brilliant blue or green or yellow, or spotted.
  Many of them are comparatively large insects, nearly an inch long, and resemble brilliantly
  coloured beetles, from which, however, they can easily be distinguished by the antenn&aelig;, the
  proboscis, and the shield, the latter of which is not divided down the middle like the wing-cases
  of beetles.</p>

      <p class="sp3">LACE-WING BUG.</p>
      <p class="sp0">An elegant little insect, injurious to pear-trees.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Next to the Shield-bugs, and considered by many entomologists as belonging to the same group,
  are the <span class="sc">Pentagonal Shield-bugs</span>, so called because the scutellum, though
  much smaller than in the Shield-bugs, is often half as long as the abdomen, and forms a broad
  triangle, sometimes broken at the sides, so as to make a five-sided plate, lying above the bases
  of the wings. Several green or brown species of this family, about half an inch long, are common
  in England among bushes. Many have a very disagreeable smell, and hence they are called <span
  class="sc">Stink-bugs</span> in America. They feed on vegetable juices, and also frequently on
  soft-bodied insects. <span class="pagenum" id="page726"><span
  class="smaller">{726}</span></span>Several species (chiefly foreign) among the Shield-bugs and the
  present group have a strong spine, or else a blunt protuberance, projecting from each
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>The remaining plant-bugs are much more numerous&mdash;at least in England&mdash;than those
  already mentioned, and form several families, which cannot be noticed in detail. Many species are
  rather small and delicate creatures, narrower and softer than the Shield-bugs and Pentagonal
  Shield-bugs, and are adorned with various colours, black and red predominating. Some have more
  transparent wings than the others, such as the beautiful little <span class="sc">Lace-winged
  Bugs</span>, one species of which is often very destructive to pear-trees.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Bed-bug</span> is a reddish-brown, somewhat oval insect, common in many
  old houses, hiding in cracks and crevices in walls and woodwork, and coming out at night to suck
  the blood of sleepers with its sharp proboscis. There are allied species, sometimes found in
  hen-houses, pigeon-houses, and places where bats congregate. The bed-bug has only been known in
  England for a few centuries, and though now a great pest in all parts of the world, was probably a
  native of Africa originally.</p>

  <p>The bed-bug, notwithstanding its offensive odour, is preyed upon by several other insects,
  among which are the common cockroach and the <span class="sc">Masked Bug</span>. The latter is a
  black-winged bug about three-quarters of an inch long, and remarkable for the habits of its larva,
  which conceals itself with dust or fluff, so that it may steal upon its prey unobserved. The
  masked bug and its larva feed on soft-bodied insects of various kinds, and are more frequently
  found in outhouses than in dwelling-rooms. This bug occasionally attacks warm-blooded animals; and
  a short time ago a great deal of nonsense was published in the newspapers about a mysterious
  insect-pest in North America, called the <span class="sc">Kissing-bug</span>, which seems to have
  been nothing more unusual than this insect. There are, however, some much larger species belonging
  to the same family, which are formidable pests in the Southern States of North America, Chili, and
  various other countries.</p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;" class="sp0"> The larv&aelig; of these insects cover themselves with
      dust, in order to creep upon their prey unnoticed.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>After these insects come the <span class="sc">Water-bugs</span>, of which there are several
  families, though the number of species is comparatively small. Some are very slender insects, with
  long, slender legs, and may be seen running on the surface of ponds in England; while others,
  which are tropical species, are marine, and are met with running on the surface of the water in
  the open sea.</p>

  <p>The largest members of the group are some of the great water-bugs found in Africa, India, and
  America. Their fore wings are of a light brown, and measure from 3 to 5 inches in expanse. Their
  legs are short and strong, and the front legs are adapted for grasping their prey, which consists
  of insects and small fishes. There are some smaller species in which the female lays her eggs in a
  cluster on the back of the male, which carries them about till they are hatched. These bugs fly
  about in the evening, and are frequently attracted by electric light.</p>

  <p>In England there are two allied species called <span class="sc">Water-scorpions</span>, from
  their long front legs, which somewhat resemble the nippers of a scorpion. The commonest is a brown
  insect, with the abdomen red beneath. It is about an inch long, including the breathing-tube,
  which sticks out behind the body like a tail, and is formed of two separable parts. It is an oval
  insect, half as broad as long, and is common in stagnant water. The other species is twice as
  long, and is much more slender, with longer and more slender legs. It is yellowish brown, like
  most of the other water-bugs, and is a sluggish and rather scarce insect, creeping about in the
  mud at the bottom of deeper water than that preferred by the commoner species.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Water-boatmen</span> are yellowish-brown insects, measuring half an inch
  in length, with smooth bodies, and long, hairy hind legs, with which they row themselves about on
  the water, as if with oars, while floating on their backs. All the larger water-bugs are capable
  of inflicting a severe puncture with their sharp proboscis, if handled incautiously.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Frog-hoppers</span> and their allies differ from the Bugs in the fore
  wings being uniform in texture throughout, and not membranous, with the tips transparent.
  Sometimes the fore wings are of a more or less horny texture, but they are frequently as
  transparent as the hind wings. All the species are plant-feeding insects.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Erroneously stated to be luminous.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The first family, the <span class="sc">Cicadas</span>, includes a number of large or
  moderate-sized species, in which the males are provided with a large, drum-like apparatus on the
  abdomen, and some of which make the loud noise for which they have long been celebrated. There is
  only one comparatively small species in England, which is rare, and almost confined to the New
  Forest. It is black, with transparent wings, about 1&frac12; inch in expanse, and has red transverse
  lines on the abdomen. The largest Indian species, however, sometimes expands 8 inches. Cicadas
  have broad heads, broad short bodies, ending rather abruptly in a point, and their larv&aelig; live in
  the ground, where they are sometimes injurious to the roots of trees. The wings are usually, but
  not always, transparent&mdash;a very common Indian and Chinese species, about 3 inches in expanse,
  being black, with large yellow spots on the fore wings. In North America and Australia cicadas are
  often miscalled Locusts.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Lantern-flies</span>, or <span class="sc">Candle-flies</span>, which form
  the next family, derive their name from having been stated to be luminous, a statement which is
  now considered very doubtful. They are insects of considerable size and bright colours,
  occasionally resembling butterflies and moths; the largest species, the <span
  class="sc">Lantern-fly</span> of South America, sometimes measures as much as 5 inches across the
  wings, which are of a pale yellowish or greenish tint, with a large round spot on the hind wings,
  formed of black rings or crescents, and enclosing one or two large white spots. On the head is an
  immense hollow, blunt protuberance, marked with one or two longitudinal red lines. In some species
  there is a curved horn in front of the head; in some the horn forms a short cross; in others it
  ends in a red knob; while others are destitute of such an appendage. The hind wings are often
  brightly coloured, red or yellow usually predominating.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page729"><span class="smaller">{729}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">True Frog-hoppers</span> are small insects about a quarter of an inch
  long, found among grass and bushes. The fore wings are of rather a stout consistency and uniform
  in colour (often yellowish), and the hind wings transparent. The larv&aelig; are soft grubs, and live in
  the masses of froth so common in grass and bushes, which are vulgarly known as "cuckoo-spit."</p>

  <p>Passing over several families of small species, we arrive at two which contain many very
  destructive insects. The <span class="sc">Aphides</span>, <span class="sc">Plant-lice</span>, or
  <span class="sc">Smother-flies</span> are the small green or brown winged or wingless insects
  which frequently cover the shoots of roses and other trees and plants, and exude a sweet sticky
  substance, called "honey-dew," very attractive to ants. One species, known as the <span
  class="sc">American Blight</span>, is extremely destructive to apple-trees, patches of a substance
  resembling white cotton appearing on the bark. Under these patches the bark rots from the attacks
  of the insects, the pest being very difficult to eradicate.</p>

  <p>Many of the Aphides exhibit the curious phenomenon known as "alternation of generations." The
  first brood consists of winged males and females; but the eggs which the latter lay produce
  exclusively wingless females, or rather sexless creatures capable of laying eggs, and these
  multiply indefinitely for a time, till perfect males and females are again reproduced. In some
  cases the winged forms live on the leaves of trees, and the wingless forms at the roots of grass,
  etc. One of the most destructive of all these insects is the <span class="sc">Vine-aphis</span>,
  which was probably introduced into Europe from America, and which threatened at one time almost to
  destroy the vine industry in France. Wingless sexless forms live and multiply at the roots of
  vines; and in summer winged males and females are produced, which fly up, and lay eggs on the
  leaves; while some of the wingless insects also quit the ground, and form small galls on the
  vine-leaves. Although very abundant in America, the insect is not nearly so destructive to the
  plants which it attacks as in Europe.</p>

  <p>Some species of <span class="sc">Scale-insects</span> are almost equally destructive,
  especially to greenhouse plants. The male is slender and two-winged, but the female is wingless
  and often legless, and after depositing her eggs usually dies above them, thus forming a covering
  to protect them from injury. Cochineal consists of the bodies of a species of scale-insect which
  infests the leaves of a cactus in Mexico.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <span class="sc">True Lice</span> are found on various species of mammals, and
  imbibe their food through a proboscis. The <span class="sc">Bird-lice</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Biting-lice</span>, form a well-defined group by themselves. They are sometimes
  regarded as forming distinct orders of insects; but some authors treat the first group as a
  degraded family of insects allied to the Frog-hoppers, and the second group as an equally degraded
  and aberrant family allied to the Lace-winged Insects.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="fine">TWO-WINGED INSECTS, OR FLIES.</span></p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">BY W. F. KIRBY, F.L.S.</span></p>

  <p>This order of insects is probably one of the most numerous in individuals, though it may be
  that, when we know more of the insect population of the world, we shall find that it is
  outnumbered in species by the Beetles or the order to which the Bees and Ants belong. It differs
  from all other orders in possessing only two wings instead of four, which is the usual number in
  insects. The metamorphoses are complete, and the mouth is furnished with a proboscis for imbibing
  liquid food. Hind wings are represented in many species by a pair of organs called "poisers,"
  resembling a knob at the end of a stick, and other species have two small additional lobes
  attached to the wing, called "winglets "; but there is no such thing as a really developed hind
  wing in any insect belonging to the group. They are always two-winged flies, except in the case of
  a few aberrant species, such as the Fleas, in which no wings, or only mere rudiments of wings, are
  to be met with. The Gnats, Daddy-long-legs, and House-flies are among the commonest
  representatives of this order.</p>

  may be distinguished by having moderately long antenn&aelig;, composed of more than six joints, and

  black eyes, which produces little yellowish or reddish maggots which injure the growing grain in
  the ear; and the <span class="sc">Hessian Fly</span>, which is brown, and produces
  semi-transparent maggots, which afterwards grow darker, and when full grown become pup&aelig; resembling
  flax-seeds. The maggots attack the stalk, feeding on the sap till the stalk cracks and bends over.
  This is an infallible sign of their presence, and of the mischief they are doing.</p>

  <p>Among the best-known insects of this group are the <span class="sc">Gnats</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Mosquitoes</span>, of which there are many genera and species. There is no difference,
  however, to permit of their being classified in two separate popular categories. In England any of
  these troublesome insects are called Gnats; out of England they are termed Mosquitoes, if we are
  tormented by them, even though they may belong to the same species as the English ones&mdash;for
  "mosquito" is merely the Spanish word for "gnat" Anglicised.</p>

  <p>Gnats breed in standing water, fresh or otherwise, but seem to prefer rain-water, for they are
  very numerous about small pools and water-butts. Consequently they were formerly far more abundant
  in England than at present, when the fens were still undrained, and when every house had <span
  class="pagenum" id="page731"><span class="smaller">{731}</span></span>its rain-water butt. The
  females of some species construct small rafts of eggs, which float about on the surface of the
  water till hatched, and then produce small maggots with a breathing-apparatus at the end of the
  tail. In this condition they swim head-downwards, while the more compact pupa floats head-upwards.
  They may be destroyed by pouring a little kerosene into their breeding-places; and as this floats
  on the surface of the water, it does not interfere with the use of the water in water-butts, which
  is usually drawn off by a tap below. The males of gnats often have feathered antenn&aelig; and long,
  slender legs. The females, however, are more nocturnal in their habits, and come into houses in
  the evening, and keep people awake by their humming and painful "bites," or rather punctures,
  which frequently cause a distressing irritation for a day or two afterwards. What is worse is that
  they are now known to disseminate various diseases, such as elephantiasis and also malarial fever
  of every kind, in this manner&mdash;from the comparatively mild ague of the English fens (now
  nearly extinct) to the terrible malaria of Southern Europe, India, and Africa, formerly attributed
  to the unhealthy atmosphere of marshy countries, or to exposure to the night air in warm
  countries, but now known to be caused by the bites of the gnats, or mosquitoes, which breed in
  swampy places, and fly about in the evening. It is believed that only certain species of gnats
  convey the germs of these diseases; and it has been stated that, though ague-bearing species of
  gnats are still found in England, those which have been examined for the purpose have been free
  from these germs, and are therefore incapable of propagating the disease.</p>

  <p>In many parts of the world gnats are excessively numerous and troublesome at certain seasons of
  the year, filling the air like clouds of dust, so that it is difficult to sleep or eat from the
  annoyance and irritation caused by their attacks. This will be readily credible to those who have
  experienced the pain which they cause even when not very numerous, and have been kept awake at
  night by their shrill piping as they approach. They appear to be equally numerous in cold and warm
  countries&mdash;Lapland, France, South Russia, Italy, various parts of America, and in fact most
  parts of the world being liable to the inordinate multiplication of different species.</p>

  <p>In England they were formerly so abundant in the fenlands that mosquito-curtains were in use
  less than a century ago, and may be so still. But their numbers have so diminished of late years
  that, whenever gnats are a little more troublesome than usual, it is reported that there has been
  an invasion of mosquitoes. A year or <span class="pagenum" id="page732"><span
  class="smaller">{732}</span></span>two ago there was a report that "mosquitoes" had been brought
  to Cromer in some fishing-vessel, and the newspapers contained paragraphs about "mosquitoes"
  having caused much annoyance in different parts of London. But many of the specimens submitted to
  the inspection of entomologists proved to be nothing more than the commonest of all the
  blood-sucking gnats, called the <span class="sc">Piping-Gnat</span> by Linn&aelig;us, on account of its
  shrill note. The note is produced by the rapid vibration of the wings, which has been estimated at
  the rate of 3,000 per minute. Gnats do not always fly near the ground. Sometimes they have been
  seen ascending from cathedrals and other high buildings in such vast swarms that they resembled
  clouds of smoke, and gave rise to the idea that the building was actually on fire.</p>

  <p>Equally troublesome and annoying are the <span class="sc">Sand-Flies</span>, as they are called
  in England, or the <span class="sc">Black-Flies</span>, as they are called in America. They are
  very small flies, short and broad, and with broader wings than gnats; and one of them, which
  actually destroys many mules and other domestic animals in the Mississippi Valley, as we learn
  from Professor Comstock, is called the <span class="sc">Buffalo-Gnat</span>, from a fancied
  resemblance of the side-view of the insect to a buffalo. Other species are equally destructive to
  the cattle in the Banat of Hungary. It is a curious circumstance that, in the case of nearly all
  two-winged flies which attack men and animals, it is usually only the females which suck blood,
  the males frequenting flowers and being perfectly harmless.</p>

  <p>Respecting mosquitoes in South America, Mr. H. W. Bates writes, in his work "The Naturalist on
  the Amazons," when passing a night in a boat about twenty-five miles from the town of Villa Nova:
  "At night it was quite impossible to sleep for mosquitoes; they fell upon us by myriads, and
  without much piping came straight at our faces as thick as rain-drops in a shower. The men crowded
  into the cabins, and then tried to expel the pests by the smoke from burnt rags; but it was of
  little avail, although we were half suffocated during the operation." But the sand-flies,
  encountered a little higher up the river, were much worse: "We made acquaintance on this coast
  with a new insect-pest, the Pi&uacute;m, a minute fly, two-thirds of a line in length, which here
  commences its reign, and continues henceforward as a terrible scourge along the upper river, or
  Solimoens, to the end of the navigation on the Amazons. It comes forth only by day, relieving the
  mosquito at sunrise with the greatest punctuality, and occurs only near the muddy shores of the
  stream, not one ever being found in the shade of the forest. In places where it is abundant, it
  accompanies canoes in such dense swarms as to resemble thin clouds of smoke. It made its
  appearance in this way the first day after we crossed the river. Before I was aware of the
  presence of flies, I felt a slight itching on my neck, wrist, and ankles, and, on looking for the
  cause, saw a number of tiny objects, having a disgusting resemblance to lice, adhering to the
  skin. This was my first introduction to the much-talked-of Pi&uacute;m. On close examination, they are
  seen to be small two-winged insects, with dark-coloured body and pale legs and wings, the latter
  closed lengthwise over the back. They alight imperceptibly, and, squatting close, fall at once to
  work, stretching forward their tiny front legs, which are in constant motion, and seem to act as
  feelers, and then applying their short, broad snouts to the skin. Their abdomens soon become
  distended and red with blood, and then, their thirst satisfied, they soon move off, sometimes so
  stupefied with their potations that they can scarcely fly. No pain is felt whilst they are at
  work, but they each leave a small circular raised spot on the skin, and a disagreeable irritation.
  The latter may be avoided in great measure by pressing out the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page733"><span class="smaller">{733}</span></span>blood which remains in the spot; but this is
  a troublesome task when one has several hundred punctures in the course of a day [like Prince
  Siror, in one of Bulwer Lytton's stories, who fell "pierced by five hundred spears"]. I took the
  trouble to dissect specimens, to ascertain the way in which the little pests operate. The mouth
  consists of a pair of thick fleshy lips, and two triangular horny lancets, answering to the upper
  lip and tongue of other insects. This is applied closely to the skin, a puncture is made with the
  lancets, and the blood then sucked through between these into the &#x0153;sophagus, the circular
  spot which results coinciding with the shape of the lips. In the course of a few days the red
  spots dry up, and the skin in time becomes blackened with the endless number of discoloured
  punctures that are crowded together. The irritation they produce is more acutely felt by some
  persons than others. I once travelled with a middle-aged Portuguese who was laid up for three
  weeks from the attacks of Pi&uacute;m, his legs being swelled to an enormous size, and the punctures
  aggravated into spreading sores."</p>

  <p>However, the traveller in Amazonia has one consolation: the great rivers which traverse the
  forests are of three different colours; and the black-water rivers&mdash;so called from the dark
  colour of the water, owing apparently to the amount of vegetable matter which they hold in
  solution&mdash;are never infested with mosquitoes. Probably the character of the water renders it
  unsuitable to them for breeding purposes.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Crane-flies</span>, or <span class="sc">Daddy-long-legs</span>, are also
  very injurious insects, but in a different manner, for their subterranean maggots feed on and
  destroy the roots of grass in the same way as the grubs of the Cockchafers. They are insects of
  considerable size, with slender bodies, terminating in a short, horny point (the ovipositor) in
  the female, and with long, slender legs, which are liable to break off at the least touch. The
  commonest species has a grey body and transparent wings; but there is a larger one with the wings
  prettily variegated with brown, and a smaller one in which there are yellow markings towards the
  end of the body.</p>

  <p>The more typical <span class="sc">Flies</span> have usually shorter and broader wings, and
  thicker, shorter, and more hairy legs, than those just mentioned; and the antenn&aelig; have usually
  only three or four joints, and are often furnished with a long, slender bristle at or before the
  end of the last joint.</p>

  <p>As in the case of the Gnats and Crane-Flies, so as regards the more typical Flies, we have only
  space to notice a few of the more important families.</p>

  <p>Some of the <span class="sc">Gad-flies</span> are no larger than house-flies, but others are as
  large as wasps or larger, with broader wings, and of a black, grey, or yellowish colour; they
  frequent fields, and settle on cattle, or on our clothes or hands. Some have transparent and
  others dark-coloured wings, but they are all capable of inflicting a severe puncture, often
  sufficient to draw blood, even in the case of the smaller species.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The prettiest of the gad-flies are the <span class="sc">Golden-eyed Flies</span>. They are
  black, with the abdomen more or less marked with yellow; and black, or black and transparent,
  wings. The eyes are of a beautiful golden green, dotted and lined with purple. They are moderately
  stout insects, about the third of an inch long, and are not uncommon. Another insect, known as the
  <span class="sc">Blood-sucking Rain-fly</span>, has a rather long and slender body for a gad-fly,
  and is nearly half an inch long. It is of a lighter or darker grey, with reddish markings on the
  sides of the abdomen in the male. The wings are greyish brown with whitish dots, and a white mark
  towards the tip. Both these flies are very troublesome, the latter chiefly on the edges of woods
  or near water, especially in rainy weather.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page734"><span class="smaller">{734}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Robber-flies</span> are large flies, with long, tapering bodies, of a
  black or partly yellow colour, and feed on smaller flies and other insects of different kinds.
  They have very thick, hairy and a strong proboscis. A handsome Australian species, allied to
  these, but with a broader body, is represented in the Coloured Plate.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Hornet Robber-fly</span>, represented on page <a href="#page731">731</a>,
  is one of the most conspicuous of the British species. Among other places, it may be seen flying
  over the short grass at the top of the cliffs between Brighton and Rottingdean. They are very
  predaceous, and are probably rather beneficial than otherwise, by contributing to keep down
  injurious insects. But in North America there is a species called the <span
  class="sc">Bee-killer</span>, which is an extremely destructive insect, taking up its station in
  front of a hive, and killing large numbers of bees as they fly backwards and forwards from the
  hive.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Hover-flies</span> are brightly coloured, rather smooth flies, and are
  familiar objects in gardens, and in open places in woods. They have the habit of hovering
  motionless in the air, and then darting off suddenly. Some of the larger species proceed from
  curious maggots, with long tails, which have been compared to the tail of a rat. These live in
  putrid water; and as the flies have a slight resemblance to bees, the fact is believed to have
  given rise to the old fable that bees are generated from the rotting carcases of oxen or other
  large animals.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Bot-flies</span> are remarkable for being parasitic on warm-blooded
  animals, their maggots living in tumours on the skin of oxen, known as "warbles," or in the
  stomach and intestines of horses, or in the nostrils and other cavities in the heads of sheep or
  deer.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">House-flies</span> and their allies form a very large group, divided into
  many families. The true house-fly is an autumn insect; but there are other flies which resemble it
  which live in houses at different times of the year. Most of them are harmless, although there is
  one species, very like a house-fly, which comes into houses in rainy weather, and inflicts a
  puncture like a gad-fly. This is the meaning of the popular saying that "the flies bite in rainy
  weather."</p>

  <p>Although house-flies do not bite, yet they are sometimes exceedingly troublesome when they are
  in unusual numbers; and as they settle everywhere, they may convey infection mechanically, though
  not as the principal agents in the dissemination of definite diseases, like the mosquitoes. Thus,
  in Egypt, they are said frequently to convey ophthalmia, a very prevalent disease in that
  country.</p>

  <p>The very first paper published in the "Transactions of the present Entomological Society of
  London" (for the existing Society had several short-lived predecessors) was a paper read by
  William Spence at the meeting on April 7, 1834, about a year after the Society had been definitely
  founded, entitled "Observations on a Mode practised in Italy of excluding the Common House-fly
  from Apartments." This desirable result is attained simply by stretching a net of white or
  coloured thread, with meshes of an inch or more in diameter, across an open window, which the
  flies will not venture to pass, if the room is lighted from one side only&mdash;"for if there be a
  <i>thorough</i> light either from an opposite or side window, the flies pass through the net
  without scruple." Mr. Spence's son also referred to a passage in Herodotus where he says that
  Egyptian fishermen in his time defended themselves from the gnats by covering their beds with the
  nets which they had used in the day for fishing, and through which these insects, though they bit
  through linen or woollen, did not even attempt to bite. The matter seems to have been overlooked
  in recent years, though it is evidently well worthy of consideration when flies or gnats are
  troublesome.</p>

  <p>There is a conspicuous insect allied to the house-flies, but a little larger, measuring about
  half an inch in length. It is called the <span class="sc">Noon-day Fly</span>, and is often seen
  in considerable numbers, in the hottest part of the day, flying round and settling on the trunks
  and leaves of trees; it also settles on cow-dung. It is a shining black fly, with the sides and
  under surface <span class="pagenum" id="page735"><span class="smaller">{735}</span></span>of the
  head golden yellow in the male; the wings are transparent, slightly tinged with pale brown, and
  bright rusty yellow towards the base.</p>

  <p>The African <span class="sc">Tsetse-fly</span> is not very unlike a house-fly, and is one of
  the worst pests to cattle in those parts of Africa which it infests; for any horse, ox, or dog
  attacked by it will infallibly die after a longer or shorter period of suffering, though wild
  animals and sucking calves are not affected by it. It used to be supposed that the fly itself
  infused some deadly venom with its puncture; but later experiments have led naturalists to the
  conclusion that the fly is not itself poisonous, but that it forms the channel of communication of
  some fatal disease, just as some species of mosquitoes convey the infection of malaria.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Blow-flies</span>, or <span class="sc">Blue-bottles</span>, of which there
  are several species closely allied to each other, are common in houses; and a smaller brilliant
  green fly, called the <span class="sc">Green-bottle Fly</span>, is common on hedges. These are all
  flies which lay their eggs on fresh or putrid meat, when it is said to be "fly-blown." They will
  also lay their eggs in open sores; and in former days the sufferings of the wounded after a battle
  were often frightfully aggravated by this cause; and at the present day farmers would frequently
  lose sheep through their attacks, if they were not carefully tended in hot weather.</p>

  <p>Various species of flies in Eastern Europe, the Southern States of America, Jamaica, etc.,
  habitually lay their eggs in the mouths or nostrils of men and animals, and the resulting maggots
  cause dreadful suffering and often death. In India, and especially in the Eastern Archipelago,
  there are some brilliantly coloured, smooth, metallic blue and green flies as big as bumble-bees.
  There is also a family of flies allied to the house-fly, which have very bristly bodies, and are
  parasitic on caterpillars, like ichneumon-flies.</p>

  <p>There are other flies which easily attract attention, such as the yellow hairy fly found about
  cow-dung, and some rather small species with prettily variegated wings, which feed on flowers or
  fruit. The cheese-hoppers are also the maggots of a small black fly.</p>

  <p>Besides these, there are some aberrant parasitic families of flies with long, hairy legs, and
  only one or two joints to the antenn&aelig;. These are the <span class="sc">Forest-flies</span> and
  <span class="sc">Bird-flies</span>, which attack horses and birds; and also some wingless insects,
  such as the so-called <span class="sc">Sheep-tick</span> (easily distinguished from a true tick by
  possessing only six legs), the <span class="sc">Bee-parasites</span>, and the spider-like <span
  class="sc">Bat-parasites</span>. This parasitic group is also remarkable for depositing full-grown
  larv&aelig; or pup&aelig; instead of eggs.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Fleas</span> are a small group of small wingless insects, with such powers
  of leaping that it has been said that if a man was as agile as a flea he could jump over the dome
  of St. Paul's. The larv&aelig; of fleas are small, worm-like creatures, with bristles, but without legs;
  they probably live on any sort of animal or vegetable refuse. They subsequently change to pup&aelig; in
  small cocoons, and emerge as perfect fleas, which live by sucking the blood of warm-blooded <span
  class="pagenum" id="page736"><span class="smaller">{736}</span></span>animals; or, when that fails
  them, they may attack caterpillars, or other small soft-bodied creatures. Though not very
  particular about their food, different species are more or less attached to different animals; and
  while in Europe the most troublesome species is the one considered to be most particularly
  attached to man, the species most troublesome in North America is known in Europe as the <span
  class="sc">Dog-flea</span>. They are all very similar in habits and appearance. Fleas are not only
  annoying, but, in conjunction with rats, are believed to be among the principal agents in the
  spread of the plague. There is another insect called the <span class="sc">Jigger</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Sand-flea</span>, common in most of the warmer parts of America, and which has more
  recently been introduced into Africa. The female burrows into the feet of men or animals, where
  her body swells up with eggs to the size of a pea; and serious and sometimes fatal ulcers are the
  ordinary result, unless the insect is carefully extracted at an early stage of the attack.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Uses of Flies.</span></p>

  <p>It must not be supposed from the foregoing observations that flies are simply and solely pests
  to man and beast, without any redeeming qualities. Their services are less required in cold and
  settled countries, but in warm climates their value as scavengers can hardly be over-estimated. As
  regards the removal of carrion alone, Linn&aelig;us declared that the progeny of only three blow-flies
  would devour the carcase of a dead horse as quickly as a lion&mdash;a statement which, even if
  slightly exaggerated, conveys a vivid idea of their voracity and the rate at which they
  increase.</p>

  <p>Flies are also useful in keeping down the multitudes of destructive insects. Numbers of
  caterpillars fall victims to the bristly flies alluded to on the last page; and the Bee-flies,
  which form a family placed next to the Gad-flies, render far greater service in destroying
  locusts. They much resemble small bumble-bees, being very much the same shape, and they are
  clothed with yellow down in the British species, and the transparent wings are conspicuously
  marked with black bands (as in the photograph above), or with brown shading and spots. The insects
  have a very rapid flight, and use their long proboscis to suck the honey of flowers; but their
  grubs are parasitic&mdash;at least in some instances&mdash;on wild bees; and it is probable that
  their resemblance to bees has some reference to this mode of life. But in Cyprus, Algeria, North
  America, etc., the larv&aelig; of allied species feed inside the egg-cases of locusts, sometimes
  destroying as large a proportion as four-fifths of the whole brood. Locusts have many enemies, but
  it will easily be seen that the attacks of foes like these must reduce their numbers considerably,
  notwithstanding the swarms which frequently survive, and which are liable to the attacks of other
  enemies, such as robber-flies, locust-birds, etc., after they have actually arrived at
  maturity.</p>

  <p>Nor must we omit to notice the use of flies as articles of food for man or useful animals. Many
  persons are very fond of cheese-hoppers, which are really the maggots of a small fly; and we read
  in Kirby's "Textbook of Entomology," page 92: "The Rev. A. E. Eaton informs me that he believes
  that two species of <i>Ephemerid&aelig;</i> (May-flies) form a portion of the so-called 'Kungu Cake,'
  manufactured by the natives of South Africa of gnats, and probably any other insects which can be
  obtained in sufficient abundance." "Gentles," which are the maggots of flies, are used by anglers
  for ground-bait.</p>

  <p>The Molluscan Group or Sub-kingdom represents one, if not the most important, of the
  invertebrate sections of living animals with relation both to its numbers and variety and in its
  commercial and economic utility to mankind. In its ranks are included all those animals generally
  known as Shell-fish, and familiar to the non-scientific in the shape of Oysters, Mussels, Whelks,
  Periwinkles, and the innumerable varieties of gorgeous or delicately tinted shells of tropical
  seas.</p>

  <p>Collectively, Molluscs differ from all such invertebrate groups as Insects, Crustaceans, and
  Worms in that they possess neither jointed limbs nor jointed bodies, their body-substance being
  enclosed by a more or less distinct muscular sac, or integument, technically known as the
  "mantle." Molluscs possess no internal skeleton; but for the protection of their soft and
  otherwise defenceless bodies the mantle is among the great majority of species endowed with the
  property of secreting a more or less indurated calcareous shell, within which, when danger
  threatens, the creature can entirely withdraw. In some species the shell secreted is relatively
  small, and serves only as a protective shield to especially vital areas; while in a third very
  considerable assemblage a shell is altogether absent. The minute yet technically recognisable
  structural differences between the shells of even the most closely allied specific forms, and the
  wider and distinctly evident divergences that separate the more remotely connected varieties,
  furnish the basis for their classification and nomenclature by the systematic conchologist.
  Molluscan shells, being so extensively preserved in the fossil state, furnish the geologist with
  invaluable data for his determination of the age and respective relationship of the fossil-bearing
  strata of the earth's crust.</p>

  <p>Having no jointed limbs, molluscs are dependent upon some other mechanical adaptation for their
  powers of locomotion. This, in the majority of species, is represented by a modification of the
  lower surface of the animal's body, <span class="pagenum" id="page738"><span
  class="smaller">{738}</span></span>which is so richly supplied with muscular tissues as to
  constitute an effective creeping-base. As a locomotive organ this muscular area is usually known
  as the "foot."</p>

  <p>Of living molluscs some 50,000 distinct species have been recorded. The great majority of these
  organisms are, as is well known, marine. A very considerable number, however, are inhabitants of
  fresh-water; while a yet smaller proportion, like the Slugs and Snails and their allies, are
  especially adapted for a terrestrial existence. Excepting two relatively small and inconspicuous
  groups, the great natural division or sub-kingdom of Molluscs is separated by systematic
  zoologists into three main sections or classes. The particular modification of the locomotive
  organ, or foot, serves, on the one hand, to readily distinguish the first or most highly organised
  group from the second or central class; while the third or lowest one is as clearly separated from
  the second and first by the character of the shell. The first and most highly developed section
  includes such species as the Octopus, the Cuttle-fish, the Squid, and the several varieties of
  Nautiluses; to the second or central group are referred all the marine and terrestrial Slugs and
  Snails with their innumerable modifications; while the third and lowest group comprises all the
  double-shelled or bivalve forms, such as Oysters and Mussels.</p>

      <p>A TASMANIAN SQUID, OR CUTTLE-FISH.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;" class="sp0"> Giant species of squids have been recorded in
      which the shorter tentacles measured 12 feet, and the two longer ones as much as 30 or 40 feet
      in length.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the <span class="sc">Octopus</span> and its allies the creeping-base, or foot, is prolonged
  round its margin into eight or more arm-like extensions. The anterior of these in the earlier
  phases of their development grow round and enclose the mouth, which consequently opens upon the
  centre of the locomotive surface. The arms of the octopus and other forms are in most instances
  provided throughout their length with complex sucking-disks, wherewith their owners can seize and
  retain their prey or walk with ease and celerity over the smoothest perpendicular or overhanging
  rock-surfaces. The octopus, as the type of its class, possesses <span class="pagenum"
  id="page739"><span class="smaller">{739}</span></span>yet another most effective locomotive organ.
  This is the so-called funnel, or siphuncle, a membranous tube connected with the capacious
  gill-cavity which is formed by a folding of the mantle on the under-surface. When at rest or
  moving leisurely, the water taken in through the pocket-like entrance to this cavity is discharged
  through the funnel without any particular effort. The animal can, however, at will leave go its
  attachment to the rocks, and propel itself swiftly through water by successive forcible expulsions
  of the water through the funnel. By directing the aperture of the funnel to the right or left, the
  creature can also direct its course in whatever direction it desires. When thus swimming, its
  translation is necessarily backwards. Another notable feature of the octopus is the "ink-bag," a
  huge gland secreting an inky-black fluid, which, as produced by the common cuttle-fish,
  constitutes the sepia of commerce. The contents of the ink-bag are discharged through the funnel
  at the will of the animal; as soon as the ink is brought into contact with the water, it becomes
  distributed through it in the form of a thick cloud, under cover of which the mollusc makes good
  its escape from any attacking enemy.</p>

  <p>The octopus in British seas by no means attains to its maximum growth. Examples with arms from
  2 to 2&frac12; feet in length are accounted large specimens. In Mediterranean waters, however, these
  dimensions are much exceeded, individuals with arms 5 feet long, which are capable of covering a
  circular area no less than 10 feet in diameter with their fully extended appendages, being
  frequently recorded. In the West Indies, on the North-west American coast, and also in Chinese
  seas, similar, if not larger dimensions are attained by these creatures. That these monster
  octopods, or "devil-fish," as they are sometimes designated, prove a source of danger to human
  life has been abundantly demonstrated. Lurking, as is their custom, among rock-crevices, they
  seize hold of any moving object which approaches within reach of their extended arms. Bathers in
  this manner have been seized and drowned, it being impossible for even the strongest swimmer to
  free himself from the clutches of one of these animals, which, while retaining a firm hold on the
  rocks with a portion of its hundred-suckered arms, has entwined the others around its victim.</p>

  <p>The natural food of the octopus are crabs, lobsters, and their like; and in places like the
  Channel Islands, where the tide retires very low, leaving the rock-fissures inhabited by the
  molluscs more or less exposed, their presence may be often foretold by the accumulation of empty,
  broken-up crab-shells around the entrances to their retreats. In common with other members of its
  tribe, the octopus is furnished with a strong, horny, parrot-like beak, wherewith it can with ease
  break through the shells of its accustomed food. The year 1900 was remarkable for the
  extraordinary abundance of the octopus on the English south coast, the result of their collective
  depredations very seriously affecting the local crab and lobster fisheries. The pots laid down
  over-night, in place of yielding the following morning their customary quota of marketable
  crustaceans, were more often than otherwise found to contain nothing but broken-up shells and a
  loathsome "devil-fish."</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Squids</span> and <span class="sc">Cuttle-fishes</span>, with their large
  lustrous eyes, are especially adapted for an open sea life, and for this purpose are furnished
  with lateral fin-like membranous expansions. A more important structural distinction is their
  possession of two supplementary appendages, which, <span class="pagenum" id="page740"><span
  class="smaller">{740}</span></span>usually retracted within special pouches when not in use, can
  be shot out to a length at least twice that of the eight ordinary arms. Both the cuttle-fish and
  the squid, or calamary, are also the possessors of an internal calcareous or horny shell which
  underlies and strengthens the upper-surface. The cuttle-bone used as a dentifrice and ink-eraser
  is the product of the first-named mollusc. The Ten-armed group, as it is named, with reference to
  the two supplementary arms, ten in all, possessed by its members, is notable for including species
  whose dimensions not only exceed those of any other invertebrate type, but whose fully extended
  length rivals that of the largest vertebrates. Giant squids, or calamaries, have been taken off
  the coast of Newfoundland, yielding, with their tentacular arms extended, a linear measurement of
  over 50 feet, associated with an estimated weight of as much as 1,000 lbs. There can be no doubt
  that these giant squids have in many instances furnished the basis of the oft-recurrent
  sea-serpent stories, more especially on those occasions where the supposed marine reptile and a
  whale have been reported as seen engaged in combat. As a matter of fact the sperm-whales
  habitually feed on deep-sea squids, and have been known, when mortally wounded, to vomit forth
  detached portions of these gigantic molluscs. The long tentacular arms of one of these monsters,
  thrown around the whale with which it had entered upon a death-struggle, might at a little
  distance be easily mistaken for some huge snake-like organism.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The various species of <span class="sc">Nautilus</span>, including the so-called "Paper" and
  "Pearly" species, belong likewise to this group of Molluscs. In the former case, however, it is
  only the female animal which secretes a shell, and this is used as a cradle wherein she deposits
  her eggs and rears her young. The pretty romance of the <span class="sc">Paper-nautilus</span>, or
  <span class="sc">Argonaut</span>, as it is technically termed, floating on the sun-lit waves with
  spreading sails and an even keel, has unfortunately been entirely dissipated by the penetrating
  search-light of modern science. The animal only floats on the surface when ill, or when torn from
  its customary pasture-fields by abnormal storms, otherwise it creeps about the sea-bottom, or
  disports itself in the sub-marine grottoes like an ordinary octopus, with which, in point of fact,
  the shell-less male agrees in all essential details. The shell-cradle of the paper-nautilus is not
  vitally connected with the body of the animal, as is that of the pearly species and all ordinary
  shell-fish. It is freely detachable from the body, and during life is grasped and held closely to
  it by the expanded extremities of the two lateral tentacles by which the delicate shell is mainly
  secreted.</p>

  <p>The next group comprises the great bulk of Simple-shelled Molluscs, of which it is impossible
  in these pages to give more than a brief enumeration of some of the most prominent. The
  Lung-breathing section, which is usually awarded the first place on the list, includes the
  familiar <span class="sc">Garden-snails</span>, the <span class="sc">Shell-less Slugs</span>, the
  <span class="sc">Fresh-water Snails</span> which come to the surface to breathe, and many distinct
  terrestrial species. The largest living representative of this group is the huge Land-snail of
  tropical West Africa, sometimes known as the <span class="sc">Agate-snail</span>, the shell of
  which is not infrequently as much as 7&frac12; inches long.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Naked-gilled Sea-slugs</span> constitute a second clearly defined group.
  All the species are essentially marine, and most abundant among seaweeds and coral-growths, over
  twenty species occurring in British seas. They are notable for the slug-like form of their body,
  which is usually supplemented by the outgrowth from it of complex, variously modified
  gill-filaments. In some species these external gills take the form of symmetrical flower-like
  tufts at the posterior end of the back, while in others simple or variously branched gills may be
  developed on the upper-surface. The colours of many of these sea-slugs are more brilliant than
  those of any other molluscs, this being especially the case with the tropical
  coral-reef-frequenting species. Bright scarlet, yellows, and blues, separately or variously
  combined, are among the dominant tints. Many of these tropical species are also of considerable
  size. One particular kind, having a flower-like dorsal gill-tuft, observed by the writer on the
  West Australian reefs, was over 10 inches long and 8 inches broad. Its general ground-colour was
  intense vermilion, relieved, however, by a frilled border nearly an inch in width of the purest
  white, with radiating streaks of scarlet. It is an interesting circumstance that these
  naked-gilled molluscs, shell-less so far as their adult phases are concerned, emerge from the egg
  with a perfectly formed, but necessarily very minute, transparent shell, resembling that of a
  garden-snail. It is consequently inferred that the group has been derived from some permanently
  shell-bearing form.</p>

  <p>The Comb-gilled section embraces the great majority of the marine molluscs having a single more
  or less convoluted or spirally twisted shell. They take their name from the circumstance that the
  gills have a compactly disposed comb-like contour. This gill-tuft is situated in an excavated
  chamber inside the shell, immediately over the neck. The <span class="sc">Common Whelk</span>, the
  <span class="sc">Pelican's-foot Shell</span>, and the <span class="sc">Winkle</span> are a few
  typical British marine representatives of this group, which, however, attains to the zenith of its
  development in the size, variety of form, and ornate coloration of its shells in tropical seas.
  The inter-tropical coral-reefs in particular yield a most abundant harvest in this direction. The
  shells in common use obtained from such a source include the ponderous <span
  class="sc">Helmet-shells</span>, or <span class="sc">Conchs</span>, employed for the manufacture
  of cameos; the <span class="sc">Giant Whelks</span> and <span class="sc">Trumpet-shells</span>,
  often over 18 inches long, used as signal-horns throughout Polynesia and on the tropical
  Australian coast; and the capacious <span class="sc">Melon-shells</span>, made to do duty for
  boat-baling and as water-vessels and general domestic receptacles throughout the same tropical
  area. To this list may be added the <span class="sc">Harp-shells</span>, <span
  class="sc">Volutes</span>, <span class="sc">Cones</span>, <span class="sc">Mitres</span>, <span
  class="sc">Olives</span>, <span class="sc">Thorny Woodcocks</span>, and a host of others prized by
  the conchologist. To this section must also be referred the innumerable species of <span
  class="sc">Cowries</span>, of which the large, boldly mottled "<span class="sc">Tiger</span>" and
  "<span class="sc">Panther</span>" species are well known. The comparatively small, yellowish,
  thickly built, porcelain-like shell of the "<span class="sc">Money-cowrie</span>" constitutes, as
  is well known, the current coin throughout extensive areas of Africa and India. It is recorded
  that as large a quantity as sixty tons of these small shells, originally collected from tropical
  seas, have been shipped from one British port alone to the African coast for commercial use within
  a single year. One very diminutive cowrie, pale pink in colour, with a delicately streaked
  surface, is indigenous to British waters.</p>

  <p>The third large group of Molluscs which demands attention is that of the Bivalves, or <span
  class="pagenum" id="page743"><span class="smaller">{743}</span></span>Leaf-gilled group. Though
  not so numerous in species as the last, it outrivals it in the enormous abundance in which the
  individuals of many varieties are produced. <span class="sc">Oysters</span>, <span
  class="sc">Mussels</span>, <span class="sc">Cockles</span>, <span class="sc">Scallops</span>, and
  other allied forms occur in closely associated colonies, constituting natural "beds" or "banks,"
  which may be of vast extent and, in at any rate the case of oysters, several feet in thickness.
  From a commercial and economic standpoint this group is undoubtedly of the highest importance to
  the human race. Not only do its members, as instanced by the foregoing forms, contribute largely
  to the world's commissariat, they also yield the much-prized material known as "mother-of-pearl"
  and the purest and most &aelig;sthetically beautiful gems&mdash;orient pearls. Pearls and
  mother-of-pearl are the products of two groups of shell-fish, respectively known as <span
  class="sc">Pearl-oysters</span> and <span class="sc">Pearl-mussels</span>. There are a
  considerable number of species, mainly denizens of tropical seas, which, like ordinary oysters and
  mussels, occur naturally in banks and beds of vast extent. In some species, such as the <span
  class="sc">Ceylon Pearl-oyster</span>, the shell is small, and the mother-of-pearl substance, or
  "nacre," as it is technically termed, so thin as to be of relatively little value. Hence the
  fishery for this species is conducted almost exclusively for the sake of the pearls, which are
  fairly numerous and frequently of the finest quality. From the tropical Australian seas
  pearl-shells of the largest size, which produce the thickest and most valuable mother-of-pearl,
  are obtained. Pearls of the best quality are more rarely found in this description of shell, and
  its fishery is prosecuted primarily on account of the substantial substance and magnificent
  quality of its nacre. A single pair of shells of this species will attain in its adult state to a
  weight of from 12 to 18 lbs. The fishery for this pearl-shell has, however, been prosecuted so
  relentlessly that bivalves of such matured age and weight are now of rare occurrence, and obtained
  only from almost inaccessibly deep waters. Unless, in point of fact, systematic methods of
  conservation and cultivation are resorted to on an extensive scale and on lines corresponding
  fundamentally with those successfully followed in the culture of ordinary commercial oysters,
  there would seem to be an imminent risk of the valuable Australian pearl-shell fisheries becoming
  depleted to more or less complete exhaustion.</p>

  class="sc">Ship-worm</span>, or <span class="sc">Teredo</span>, on the other hand, there would
  appear to be no description of wood that can withstand its ravages.</p>

  <p>The Bivalve Molluscs are not without fresh-water representatives. The well-known <span
  class="sc">Pond-</span> and <span class="sc">River-mussels</span>, which form the most conspicuous
  examples of this group, number several hundred species. While insipid and of no account for the
  human commissariat, many of its members produce pearls of value. One such, obtained from the river
  Conway, in North Wales, is said to occupy a place in the crown of England.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The <span class="sc">Chitons</span>, or <span class="sc">Multivalve
  Molluscs</span>, invite brief notice. As the last-named title implies, the shell-elements in this
  group are relatively numerous, consisting of eight pieces, or plates, which may form contiguous
  transverse shelly shields that entirely cover in and protect the dorsal surface of the elongate,
  boat-shaped body, or may be more or less isolated from one another. In the former instance the
  animal bears some considerable resemblance to a gigantic limbless wood-louse, and, like that
  familiar terrestrial crustacean, it is capable of rolling itself into a spheroidal shape as a
  means of protection. None of the chitons are provided with eyes in the adult state in that region
  of their body&mdash;namely, the head&mdash;where they might be most naturally expected to exist.
  Recent scientific investigation has, however, elicited the fact that in various species the
  respective shell-plates are studded with minute eye-specks, the aggregate number of visual organs
  thus possessed by certain forms reaching to the astonishing figures of 11,000 or 12,000. The
  majority of the chitons are shallow-water, rock-frequenting molluscs, which may be successfully
  sought by turning over stones at low water. Several species are inhabitants of British seas.</p>

  II.</span></h2>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>LAMP-SHELLS.</i></p>

  <p>A little group of double-shelled creatures, formerly regarded as near allies of the Oysters and
  Mussels, are the <span class="sc">Lamp-shells</span>. Their scientific appellation, signifying
  "arm footed," relates to the two spirally convoluted arm-like structures which constitute the
  salient features in these animals. That of lamp-shells bears reference to the small circular
  perforation near the extremity, or "beak," of the united shells, which imparts to the entire
  structure a not altogether remote resemblance to an ancient Greek or Roman lamp with its
  sub-terminal wick-hole. In all essential points of their organisation the lamp-shells differ so
  essentially from ordinary bivalves that they are now generally recognised as representing an
  independent animal class, having, as a matter of fact, a closer relationship with Worms than with
  Molluscs. In their earlier condition certain lamp-shells are indistinguishable from larval worms;
  while the convoluted arms of the adult animals, thickly beset with bristles and hairs, closely
  resemble the arms, or "cirrhi," of many sea-worms. The superadded valves of the lamp-shells differ
  fundamentally from those of the bivalve molluscs in the circumstance that they are developed upon
  the upper and lower surfaces respectively of the enclosed animal, and not on the sides. The union
  between the two valves is also accomplished through the medium of interlocking calcareous teeth,
  in place of a horny or ligamentous hinge-joint, as obtains in an oyster or a mussel. A
  supplementary calcareous support, having a corresponding spiral shape, is also developed in
  connection with the convoluted arms. This structure varies in the contour of its minuter details
  in every specific form, which thus furnishes zoologists with a basis for systematic
  classification. The lamp-shells collectively form two natural groups or orders. In one of these
  the shells are hinged together, and are of conspicuously unequal dimensions. The larger shell of
  the two is more distinctly concave and produced into a perforated beak. It is this structure that
  in some species resembles the wick-hole of an antique lamp, and has given rise to the popular
  title by which these shells are distinguished. The second or hingeless group is further
  distinguished by the shells being of almost uniform shape and size. In the most interesting
  example of this group, known as <span class="sc">Lingula</span>, the two shells are thin, horny,
  of a green tint, and mounted on a long, flexible, worm-like stalk. Like a worm, this creature
  moves about in the mud, and constructs a sand-lined dwelling-tube.</p>

  class="sc">Brittle-stars</span>, <span class="sc">Sea-urchins</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Sea-cucumbers</span> all agree structurally with one another and differ from all other

  their protecting skin is more or less extensively impregnated externally and strengthened
  internally with calcareous elements which take the form of plates and spines and spicules.</p>

      <p class="sp0">This species is used for food in Italy and other Continental countries.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Common Sea-urchin</span> may be cited as an example in which these
  calcareous elements attain their maximum development. The subspherical box-like case or shell,
  wherein all the vital organs are enclosed and safely protected, is a common object of the
  seashore, and, empty and denuded of its external coating of prickly spines, familiarly known as a
  "sea-egg." Examined closely, this shell is found to consist of a series of calcareous plates,
  which dovetail or fit together in juxtaposition with the utmost nicety. The surface of the shell
  is studded throughout with rounded hemispherical knobs, those of a larger size having a very
  distinctly symmetrical plan of distribution. These rounded knobs are the bases of attachment of
  the spines, which radiate at all points from the surface of the shell when the animal is alive. It
  will be further recognised on a nearer examination that the walls of the shell are pierced <span
  class="pagenum" id="page747"><span class="smaller">{747}</span></span>on a definitely symmetrical
  pattern with minute perforations, such perforations being most distinctly visible on the inner
  surface of the shell. These minute punctures are the apertures through which in life the delicate
  tubular locomotive organs, or so-called "feet," are thrust out and retracted. The majority of
  these tubular organs terminate in a circular sucking-disk, wherewith, collectively, the urchin is
  able to adhere to and travel over the surface of the smoothest rock, or even up the glass walls of
  an aquarium. In the empty beach-gathered urchin-shell a circular hole may be observed at the two
  opposite poles, the one in the centre of the lower and flatter surface being the larger of the
  two. It is within this lower and larger one that the mouth, with its complex apparatus of teeth,
  is suspended. The membranous disk which covers the upper and smaller circular aperture in the
  living animal is perforated centrally by the vent, and around it are grouped the eye-spots and
  sundry excretory apertures.</p>

      <p class="sp3">LONG-SPINED SEA-URCHINS.</p>
      <p class="sp0">The needle-like spines of these sea-urchins are over a foot in length. Acres of
      these creatures may be sometimes seen on tidally exposed areas of the Queensland Great Barrier
      Reef, where this photograph was taken.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A noteworthy feature associated with the greater portion of the structural details of the
  sea-urchin which have been enumerated is the dominance of the number five in the constituent
  elements. It is found, for instance, that the perforated areas through which the tube-feet are
  protruded form, as with the petals and other elements of many flowers, five symmetrically
  corresponding segments. The dental apparatus comprises five equivalent tooth-like structures, and
  there are five eye-spots and five excretory apertures at the upper pole. This particular number,
  with multiples of the same, is furthermore characteristic of all the typical members <span
  class="pagenum" id="page748"><span class="smaller">{748}</span></span>of the class. Thus, in the
  <span class="sc">Common Star-fish</span>, there are five so-called arms, five eye-spots, one at
  the tip of each arm, and five equivalent elemental components of all the more important viscera.
  In the <span class="sc">Sea-cucumbers</span>, which have elongate worm-like bodies, there is a
  similar apportionment of the nerves and muscles of the body generally into fives, and also of the
  branching tentacles which surround the mouth. Tubular locomotive organs, the so-called
  "tube-feet," are common to all the three types enumerated. The calcareous plates and spinules,
  while attaining to a maximum development in the urchins, are also abundantly represented in the
  other groups. In the common star-fish these calcareous elements form within the skin an openly
  reticulated trellis-like framework, while in the ordinary sea-cucumbers they more usually take the
  form of innumerable microscopically minute spicules. The two less familiarly known groups of the
  <span class="sc">Feather-stars</span> and <span class="sc">Brittle-stars</span> fully agree with
  the previously enumerated types in their five-fold structural composition. The brittle-stars have
  almost invariably five arms only, but they are independent outgrowths from the body proper,
  instead of being prolongations of it, as in the common star-fish.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Feather-stars</span>, which include some of the rarest and most beautiful
  representatives of the group, are mostly inhabitants of deep water, and remarkable for the
  circumstance that either throughout life or in their early phases they are affixed to submarine
  objects by slender stalks. This peculiarity imparts to the animals such a flower-like aspect that,
  in conjunction with the indurated calcareous nature of their skeletons, they have received the
  title of "Stone-lilies." This appellation, however, was originally more particularly applied to
  their fossilised remains, which occur in remarkable abundance in the older geological strata.</p>

  <p>The most familiar British representative of the group is the <span class="sc">Rosy
  Feather-star</span>, occasionally obtained among seaweed in rock-pools on the southern coast, but
  more often brought up with the dredge from deeper water. In this form the elongate feather-like
  arms radiate from the central, relatively small, five-rayed body. There is no supporting
  foot-stalk in this adult stage, the animal being freely movable, and clinging to seaweeds and
  other objects by means of a cluster of claw-like filaments developed upon its under-surface.
  Releasing its hold upon its temporarily selected position, it can crawl about with the aid of the
  hooked extremities of its arms and their radiating joints. It can also propel itself through the
  water in a somewhat clumsy fashion by the consecutive flexion and extension of these appendages.
  This freedom of locomotion was not, however, always possessed by the feather-star. In its early
  days, and when of very small size, it was affixed to a slender foot-stalk, and dependent for its
  food on the animalcules and other minute organisms which drifted or swam within reach of its
  extended arms. The rosy feather-star takes its name from the bright rose-red tints by which it is
  usually characterised. Individuals of the species are, however, subject to considerable
  colour-variation. On the Australian coast, where many forms are abundantly represented, examples
  tinted deep crimson, black, bright golden yellow, or sundry admixtures of these several hues are
  not uncommonly found associated among a dredge-haul of these elegant sea-stars.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Permanently Stalked Stone-lilies</span> are at the present day of rare
  occurrence. Up <span class="pagenum" id="page749"><span class="smaller">{749}</span></span>to
  within comparatively recent years the so-called <span class="sc">Medusa's-head Lily</span> was,
  indeed, regarded as the only living representative of the group. This species has a pentagonal
  jointed foot-stalk that may be 3 feet long, with five slender appendages developed in whorls at
  short sub-equal distances throughout its length. From the shallow cup-shaped body at the apex of
  the stalk a tassel-like bundle of arms is developed, all of these being produced by repeated
  bifurcation from one of the five equivalent basal stem-joints. Dredging expeditions have within
  the last quarter of a century revealed the existence of a considerable number of previously
  unknown species of stone-lilies in the abysses of the ocean, a depth of no less than 3,200 fathoms
  representing the habitat of one such type.</p>

  <p>The Star-fish group is represented by the <span class="sc">Common Five-fingers</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Cross-fish</span>, as it is sometimes called, and includes a very numerous assemblage
  of species of varying size and shape and colour. The British seas alone yield some twenty forms.
  Among the more notable of these is the <span class="sc">Sun Star-fish</span>, which, departing
  from the rule of possessing five arms only, has twelve or more, its contour, from which it derives
  its name, somewhat resembling that of a symbolic sun. The colours of this species are particularly
  brilliant, consisting usually of a variably patterned admixture of crimson, pink, and white. An
  extreme contrast in contour to the sun-star is presented by the so-called <span
  class="sc">Bird's-foot</span> species, in which the body is pentagonal and so flattened out as to
  somewhat resemble the foot of a duck. In the Cushion-stars the body, while pentagonal, is
  comparatively thick.</p>

  <p>The so-called <span class="sc">Snake-armed Sand-stars</span> and <span
  class="sc">Brittle-stars</span> constitute a section distinguished from the preceding by the
  character of the arms, which branch separately from the central body, and are composed of an
  innumerable series of calcareous joints, which snap asunder under the slightest provocation. The
  great majority of the species are provided with five simple arms only. In an exceptional form,
  however, known as the <span class="sc">Shetland Argus</span>, and its allies, these five arms,
  while simple at their base, bifurcate repeatedly and in geometrical progression to such an extent
  as to form in life a complex network of writhing, snake-like tendrils, that has been appropriately
  likened to a Medusa's head. It has been calculated that there are no less than 80,000 terminal
  arm-subdivisions in adult examples of this species.</p>

  <p>Among the Sea-urchin Tribe there are many notable departures from the typical form <span
  class="pagenum" id="page750"><span class="smaller">{750}</span></span>previously referred to. In
  some, while the sub-spheroidal form of the case, or test, is still retained, the external spiny
  armature is greatly varied. In one series these spines are exceedingly long, slender, and of
  needle-like contour and sharpness. In others, while long, they are abnormally thick and
  cylindrical, somewhat resembling slate-pencils, for which they are sometimes used as a substitute;
  or they may be club-shaped, branched, or reduced to flattened plates. In other forms the shell
  itself is conspicuously modified. With some known as <span class="sc">Biscuit-</span> or <span
  class="sc">Cake-urchins</span> it is flattened out to the resemblance of a cake or biscuit, the
  spines being minute and inconspicuous. In another group, distinguished as <span
  class="sc">Heart-urchins</span>, the shell is oval and bilaterally symmetrical, though the
  dominant number of five still holds good with regard to the building up of its structural details.
  One of the most interesting is the <span class="sc">Leather-urchin</span>, so called on account of
  the flexible and loosely jointed character of its shell, the way being paved by such a form to the
  normally soft- and flexible-skinned sea-cucumbers. Sea-urchins are to a great extent
  vegetable-feeders, and the larger species are appreciated as an article of food in many countries,
  the ovaries, or roe, with which at certain periods the shell is mostly filled, forming the edible
  portion.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Sea-cucumbers</span>&mdash;better known in the commercial world as
  B&ecirc;che-de-mer, or Trepang&mdash;represent the only group which possesses a substantial
  market-value. Its typical members present an elongate worm-like contour, but progress by means of
  extensile tube-feet, after the manner of the Urchins and Star-fishes, and have their dental,
  nervous, and muscular systems fashioned on the same five-sectioned basis. The mouth, which is
  situated at one extremity of the body, is surrounded by a series of ten or twenty delicately
  branched or mop-like tentacles, which can be protruded or retracted at the animal's will, and are
  used for seizing food. The skin of the typical sea-cucumber is more or less soft and flexible, and
  has embedded within its substance innumerable minute calcareous spinules.</p>

  <p>The commercially valuable sea-cucumbers, or b&ecirc;che-de-mer, are all inhabitants of tropical
  waters, the North-eastern Australian coast and the Malay seas yielding the most highly prized
  forms. The Queensland Great Barrier Reef, consisting of a series of coral-reefs extending for
  upwards of 1,000 miles at a little distance from the Australian mainland, represents one of the
  most productive areas for this marine delicacy, the bulk of which goes to the Chinese market. The
  fishery is prosecuted with the assistance mainly of the Queensland natives, who, either by diving
  or wading on the reefs at low tide, collect the creatures in vast quantities. On being brought to
  the curing-stations, the animals are emptied from the collecting-sacks into large caldrons, where
  they are allowed to stew in their own juice for about twenty minutes. Taken out of the caldrons,
  they are split open and eviscerated, dried for a short interval in the sun, and then placed in
  tiers on wire gratings in a smoke-house, where they remain for twenty-four hours. They should at
  this stage have shrunk up to about one quarter of their normally extended size, much resemble
  charred sausages in aspect, and should rattle like dry walnuts when bagged up for exportation.
  From &pound;50 to &pound;150 per ton are the prices that the better qualities of b&ecirc;che-de-mer realise when
  well cured and delivered at Chinese ports. The chief culinary use to which the cured sea-cucumbers
  are applied is that of the concoction of soup, the best quality prepared taking rank with that
  made from swallows' nests. At the hotels and clubs in the leading Australian cities <span
  class="pagenum" id="page751"><span class="smaller">{751}</span></span>b&ecirc;che-de-mer soup is held in
  high favour, and its more extensive introduction on the menu-cards of Western civilisation may be
  only a question of time.</p>

  <p>Many species of sea-cucumbers inhabit British seas, but none possess that density of tissue
  which is essential for their economic conservation; the majority, moreover, are of comparatively
  small size, some few inches long only when fully extended, whereas the commercially valuable
  tropical ones may measure as much as from 2 to 3 feet. The mode of feeding of sea-cucumbers is
  somewhat interesting; the smaller species, with much-branching tentacles, generally affix
  themselves by their tube-feet to some object, and, extending their tentacles in all directions,
  utilise them, like those of a sea-anemone, for seizing any minute and suitable prey which may
  strike against them. The microscopic organisms on which they chiefly feed abound in the waters
  they inhabit, and one after the other, the branched tentacles having effected a capture, are
  gathered together and tucked bodily into the creature's central mouth and apparently half-way down
  its throat. The larger coral-frequenting species are provided mostly with mop-shaped tentacles.
  They crawl about leisurely in search of their food, mopping over the ground, and gathering up in
  their tentacles the minute shells and other organisms on which they subsist, which are
  collectively thrust with an indrawn tentacle into the throat. In some of the lower forms the
  tube-feet have disappeared, the integument is thin and semi-transparent, and the worm-like animal
  crawls about by means of its skin-spinules, which take the form of anchors or grappling-hooks. In
  an opposite direction they may develop a supplementary covering of dermal plates and a more rigid
  integument, which indicate their nearer relationship with sea-urchins.</p>

  <p>The majority of sea-urchins and star-fishes pass through a series of interesting metamorphoses
  before arriving at the adult state. The larval phases in these instances are free-swimming
  organisms, having arm-like processes, strengthened by calcareous rods that have been likened in
  contour to a clock-stand. A small spherical central area, like a clock in its case, representing
  the stomach of the larva, develops spicules around it, and becomes the body of the urchin, the
  other <span class="pagenum" id="page752"><span class="smaller">{752}</span></span>outlying
  portions becoming gradually absorbed. Some of the brittle-stars and sea-cucumbers bring forth
  their young in the adult form, nursing them from the egg in special breeding-chambers.</p>

  <p>The capacity of a star-fish to renew its lost arms is commonly manifested. A single detached

  back into the water, under the impression that they are thus effectually incapacitating them from
  further injury to their oyster-beds, commit an error, such mutilation tending to the

  <p>In the matter of colour-ornamentation the Star-fish group is richly endowed. Allusion to the
  brilliant crimson and pink-and-white tints of the British sun star-fish has been already made. As
  with most animal groups, however, it is amid their tropical representatives that the most striking
  colour-variations obtain. One form which is common among the coral-reefs on the Queensland
  coast-line, and much resembles the common British "five-fingers" in size and shape, is brilliant
  ultramarine-blue. Another large pentagonal species, belonging to the group known as Cushion-stars,
  has a golden-brown ground, upon which are thickly scattered small bead-like tubercles of
  turquoise. A third form, not uncommon on the Tasmanian coast-line, which is nearly related to the
  Bird's-foot species, previously mentioned, is distinguished by tints which range through several
  shades of crimson to brilliant violet.</p>

  <p>Not a few of the star-fishes are notable for their eminent phosphorescent properties. The group
  of the Snake-armed and Brittle-stars are more especially distinguished in this respect. Many of
  these species occur in such numbers in <span class="pagenum" id="page753"><span
  class="smaller">{753}</span></span>comparatively deep water that the dredge may be filled with a
  tangled mass of their writhing snake-armed bodies. Should it be night when the dredge is brought
  aboard, and its contents are emptied upon the deck, the spectacle presented as the star-fishes
  scramble in all directions, their bodies and arms aglow with pale green or blue phosphoric
  coruscations, is highly remarkable.</p>

  <p>A little group of animals whose relationship with the sub-divisions previously and hereafter
  described cannot be very definitely determined is that of the <span
  class="sc">Moss-animals</span>, sometimes designated <span class="sc">Corallines</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Lace-corals</span>. All its members are of exceedingly minute size, and if living
  separately would be scarcely discernible to the unaided vision. They are, however, in the habit of
  forming stocks, or colonies, after the manner of corals, by a process of continual budding, and in
  this way build up social aggregations which may be of considerable dimensions. The majority are
  marine, and largely in evidence on almost every seashore in the form of the so-called <span
  class="sc">Sea-mats</span>, consisting of masses of minute, light brown, horny cells, which take
  the form of seaweeds, or are spread in thin, lace-like encrustations upon the surfaces of shells,
  stones, and the larger seaweeds. The living inhabitants of these cells are as transparent as
  glass, their most characteristic feature being the elegant shuttle-cock-shaped crown of tentacles
  which is thrust out or withdrawn at will from the aperture of each tiny tenement. The assistance
  of the microscope is requisite for the apprehension of these details, as also of the somewhat
  complex alimentary and other organs enclosed within the component cells.</p>

  <p class="sp5">A comparatively small number of these moss-animals are inhabitants of fresh-water,
  forming brown tubular aggregations on the under side of the leaves of water-lilies or other
  submerged objects. It is interesting to observe that the tentacular crown in almost all these
  fresh-water species is horseshoe-shaped, instead of like a shuttle-cock, as in the marine forms.
  One very notable fresh-water species is remarkable for the circumstance that in place of horny
  tubes the component individuals secrete a common transparent gelatinous matrix, which is provided
  with a creeping-base, wherewith the colony-stock is enabled to travel over the surfaces of the
  water-plants among which it lives, or up the glass sides of an aquarium. In some respects, and
  more especially their earlier developmental phases, the Moss-animals show affinities with the
  Lamp-shells, while the tentacular crown of the adult individual is closely imitated in certain
  worms.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.6ex;"><i>WORMS.</i></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Worms</span> and their allies embrace a numerous assemblage of animals
  which exhibit a remarkable amount of variation both in structure and habits. A fundamental
  distinction which serves to separate readily even the most highly organised members of the group
  from the other articulate or jointed-bodied animals, such as Crabs, Insects, or Centipedes, is
  furnished by the character of the locomotive appendages. These in the Worm Tribe never assume a
  jointed character, but take the form of unjointed membranous processes which may or may not be
  supplemented by bristles. Frequently bristles alone constitute the essential locomotive organs. In
  certain groups, such as the Leeches, Flat-worms, Thread-worms, and others, even these are
  unrepresented.</p>

  <p>The appropriate title of <span class="sc">Bristle-worms</span> has been conferred upon the
  section in which the locomotive organs take the form of bristles. Among these the <span
  class="sc">Common Earth-worm</span> is included. At first sight the worm's body appears to be
  perfectly smooth and naked; it is found, however, on closer investigation to be furnished,
  according to the species, with either two or four longitudinal rows of fine, hook-like bristles.
  Although these bristles project but slightly above the surface of the skin, they constitute very
  effective aids to locomotion, enabling the animal to obtain a secure grip upon the surface of the
  ground over which it may be travelling. Progression under such conditions is effected, in fact, on
  the same principle as that of the snake, the ends of the stiff bristles with which the segments
  are armed fulfilling the same role as the projecting edges of the reptile's scales. Earth-worms
  are chiefly vegetable-feeders, dragging into their holes fallen leaves, straws, and every <span
  class="pagenum" id="page755"><span class="smaller">{755}</span></span>other description of
  vegetable d&eacute;bris. They also swallow and pass through their systems large quantities of earth,
  absorbing from it its organic constituents, and depositing the indigestible residuum therefrom in
  the form of "earth-casts." The useful function thus performed by worms in bringing up earth from
  considerable depths and redepositing it upon the surface of the ground has been fully demonstrated
  in one of Mr. Darwin's works. There are some twenty species of British earth-worms, none of which,
  however, attain to the proportions of certain kinds indigenous to Australia and South Africa. Some
  of these giant species are as much as 3 or 4 feet long when unextended, and will on the stretch
  measure twice such lengths. Their thickness, which is proportionate, may vary from that of a man's
  finger to that of an ordinary sausage.</p>

  <p>The most numerically abundant and structurally varied representatives of the bristle-bearing
  worms are inhabitants of the sea, and are divisible into two easily recognised natural groups. In
  one of these the animals resemble earth-worms in their ability to move about freely from place to
  place. In the other group they secrete and permanently reside within a tubular edifice, which may
  be calcareous and of shell-like hardness, or composed of particles of sand, mud, or other
  substances. The free-roving group, which embraces by far the larger number, includes such forms as
  the <span class="sc">Lug-worm</span>, or <span class="sc">Lob-worm</span> (held in high repute for
  fishing-baits), and a host of other allied species. In all of these the development of bristles
  and other appendages is more pronounced than in the Earth-worms. In another group, known as the
  <span class="sc">Nereids</span>, the elongate worm-like body is more or less flattened in shape;
  unjointed leg-like appendages, supplemented by bristles, are developed from the majority of the
  segments, and the animal presents a somewhat centipede-like aspect. This likeness is further
  enhanced by the presence of antenn&aelig;-like organs at the anterior extremity, while the mouth is
  armed internally with a pair of sharp-pointed, horny jaws. In many of the nereids the lateral
  organs are flattened out and paddle-like, constituting effective swimming-structures. Some of the
  larger species attain a length of several feet, and are especially noteworthy for the brilliantly
  iridescent tinting of their skins. The palm of beauty with respect to its brilliant colouring must
  undoubtedly, however, be awarded to the so-called <span class="sc">Sea-mouse</span>, frequently
  cast up by storms on the British coast. In this creature the body is comparatively short and
  thick, 3 or 4 inches long by 1&frac12; to 2 inches wide. The centre of the back is covered in by a

  those forms which build up a hard calcareous dwelling-tube, one of the gill-filaments is usually
  so modified as to constitute a stopper-like organ, wherewith the animal, on retreating into its
  domicile, can effectually bar out the ingress of intruders. In some members of the group the
  gill-tufts are elegantly branched and supplemented by long, simple, thread-like filaments, that

  the further lengthening and enlargement of the tube.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Leeches</span> differ essentially from the Bristle-worms in the absence of

  While the <span class="sc">Medicinal</span> and so-called <span class="sc">Horse-leeches</span>
  inhabit fresh-water, some, more especially in tropical countries, infest the moist jungles and
  scrubs in vast numbers, and are among the most actively aggressive pests with which the traveller
  has to contend. A few leeches also inhabit the sea, preying upon the skate and other fishes. The
  bodies of these marine species are cylindrical, with a sucker at each extremity, and roughly
  corrugated or warted.</p>

  and character according to the species, surround the mouth of this partially inverted sac. There
  is no distinct intestinal track, the whole space enclosed within the outer wall and ramifying
  among the radiating partitions containing the digestive juices. The radiating membranous

  <p>Some thirty odd species of sea-anemones are indigenous to British waters, and one or more of
  these will be familiar to most readers. The <span class="sc">Strawberry-anemone</span>, clinging
  to the rocks as a hemispherical lump of crimson, green, brown, or red and yellow speckled jelly
  when the tide is down, and expanding like a beautiful flower when the waters flow back upon it, is
  the commonest and in many respects the most beautiful of all, the circlet of turquoise beads,
  regarded as rudimentary eyes, developed around the outer margin of the tentacles, adding a charm
  possessed by few other species. The <span class="sc">Dahlia-anemone</span>, whose expanded disk
  and innumerable petal-like tentacles may measure as much as 6 or 8 inches in diameter, is the
  largest British species. These dimensions are, however, vastly exceeded by its tropical allies.
  The Australian coast produces giant species which may measure no less than from 18 inches to 2
  feet across their expanded disks. These giant anemones are further interesting on account of the
  circumstance that they are self-constituted "harbours of refuge" to sundry species of fishes and
  crabs, which nestle among their tentacles like birds in a leafy bower. The anemones are themselves
  bright in colour, but the associated fishes are even more so. In an example which was photographed
  by the writer on the Western Australian coast, the anemone was olive-green, with the tips of the
  tentacles bright mauve. The fishes, of which three examples were present, were brilliant
  orange-scarlet with white bands. In addition to the fishes a small flat-clawed crab shared the
  sheltering hospitality of the anemone. Some of the tropical coral-reef-frequenting anemones, which
  have their tentacles beautifully branched, must be cautiously handled, in consequence of their
  notable stinging properties. All sea-anemones and corals are, in fact, provided with peculiar
  stinging-cells, with which they benumb and thus make an easy capture of the living organisms on
  which they prey. While the majority of the sea-anemones live single or individually separate
  lives, there are some which form aggregations or colony-stocks of numerous units. These compound
  growths are brought about by repeated budding, or the sub-division or fission, without complete
  separation, of an originally single individual. It is by a similar process of recurrent
  sub-division that the wonderful fabrications of the coral-polyps are built up.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Branching stag's horn corals are chiefly represented in this group. Several of
      the large solitary mushroom-corals may, however, be observed in the foreground.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>An ordinary coral-animal or polyp, as previously stated, differs in no respect from a
  sea-anemone, excepting for the possession of a calcareous skeleton secreted within its basal
  tissues, including portions of the membranous radiating partitions. Some coral-animals, like the
  majority of the Anemones, are solitary, and form single attached or loosely lying corals. The
  well-known <span class="sc">Mushroom-coral</span> is one of the latter. One species observed,
  which was photographed through the water by the writer as it lay expanded in a tide-pool on the
  Australian Great Barrier Reef, might easily be mistaken for a big sea-anemone allied to the
  dahlia-anemone. On being disturbed, however, it immediately shrinks back upon its base, ejecting
  all the water with which its expanded tissues were filled, and revealing the presence of the hard
  radiating coral beneath. Each of the calcareous radii, which are now clearly defined through the
  thin semi-transparent skin, corresponds in position with one of the internal membranous
  partitions, and also with the origin of one of the tentacles. New mushroom-corals are produced as
  buds thrown off from the parent, which attach themselves and secrete a foot-stalk, to which they
  remain affixed, like the young of the feather star-fish, for the earlier epoch of their existence.
  Ultimately, however, they become detached, and, falling from their stalks, lie loosely on the
  sea-bottom, after the manner of their parents. The huge coral-masses commonly known as <span
  class="sc">Madrepores</span>, out of which coral-islands and reefs are constructed, all commence
  as a single coral-animal, with its contained skeleton analogous to the mushroom-coral, though in
  all instances much smaller. The buds developed by the coral-polyp in these instances remain
  attached to the parent. If they spread out laterally, they build up by accumulation the large
  flattened or sub-spherical masses known as <span class="sc">Brain-corals</span> and <span
  class="sc">Star-corals</span>, which are most abundant on coast-line reefs, or form the bases of
  the outer barrier-reefs. Where, on the other hand, the budding is terminal or oblique, branching
  tree-like growths such as the <span class="sc">Stag's-horn Corals</span>, with their innumerable
  allies and variations, are produced. The colours of the coral-polyps are as brilliant and diverse
  as those of ordinary sea-anemones, living reefs, whereon a number of different species are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page762"><span class="smaller">{762}</span></span>in a condition of healthy
  growth, yielding a spectacular effect that vies with that of any floral parterre. Sometimes large
  areas, acres upon acres in extent, may be covered with one almost uniform purple, green, brown, or
  other coloured growth of the branching stag's-horn species. The aspect presented is not unlike
  that of a heath-covered common.</p>

  <p>In addition to the solid, calcareous-skeletoned Madrepores, or "Stony Corals," as they are
  often termed, there are a number of species in which a skeleton composed only of loosely
  aggregated calcareous spicules is produced. The so-called <span class="sc">Flexible Corals</span>,
  or <span class="sc">Sea-fans</span>, belong to this category, as also the precious <span
  class="sc">Coral of Commerce</span>. In the last-named species the solid, brilliantly coloured
  skeleton so much prized as an article of jewellery is deposited as a supplementary basis outside
  the tissues by which the star-patterned skeletons of the stony corals are secreted.</p>

  <p>A group which demands brief notice is that of the <span class="sc">Hydroid Polyps</span>. These
  include the majority of the <span class="sc">Jelly-fishes</span>, a few coral-secreting species,
  and the organisms whose seaweed-like horny skeletons, known as <span class="sc">Sea-firs</span>,
  are, in common with those of Sea-mats, included among the flotsam and jetsam on every sea-beach.
  In the <span class="sc">Common Hydra</span>, or <span class="sc">Freshwater Polyp</span>, an
  exceptional fresh-water representative of this group is presented. It may be likened to a tiny
  sea-anemone, having, when extended, a slender foot-stalk and long thread-like tentacles. Like a
  sea-anemone, it will shrink up when disturbed into a mere button of jelly. Its organisation is
  more simple than that of the anemone, its body-cavity being a simple sac, without any intucking of
  the orifice, or strengthening by supplementary membranous partitions. A similar simple structural
  plan is characteristic of all the organisms belonging to the series. An interesting phenomenon
  connected with the fresh-water hydra is the circumstance, demonstrated now over a century ago,
  that, if one of these animals be cut up into little pieces, each separate fragment is capable of
  repairing itself and growing into a new polyp.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Jelly-fishes</span>, or <span class="sc">Medusas</span>, and their allies
  would appear at first sight to possess but little structurally in common with the Coral-polyps and
  Sea-anemones. In their most familiar form they are represented by a more or less translucent
  bell-shaped body, which drifts with the current or propels itself through the water by its
  alternate expansions and contractions. In the centre of the lower surface, occupying the position
  of the bell's clapper, a polyp-like, tubular mouth is usually discernible, and this is frequently
  surrounded by a circle of tentacles, sometimes simple and sometimes elaborately ramified. Long,
  thread-like tentacles are also commonly developed around the margin of the swimming-bell.</p>

  <p>The larger number of the jellyfishes are, as a matter of fact, transitional phases only of the
  fixed hydroid polyps previously referred to. In certain instances the body of the fixed polyp
  becomes elongated, and splits up horizontally into a series of jelly-fishes, or medusas,
  resembling a pile of saucers, which consecutively break away and lead a free-roving existence. In
  other forms a compound tree-like growth gives birth to medusa-like buds, like the flowers on a
  plant, which ultimately become detached and swim away. What are known as the <span
  class="sc">Comb-bearing Jelly-fishes</span>&mdash;their locomotive organs consisting of comb-like
  bands of vibratile hairs&mdash;are especially noteworthy. In some of these the body is nearly
  spherical or ovate, one of the species, in reference to its shape, being popularly known as the
  <span class="sc">Sea-lemon</span>. A notable feature of these medusas is their remarkable
  glass-like transparency, their presence in the water in many instances being recognisable only by
  the prismatic glimmerings of their rows of vibratile hairs when the light falls upon them at a
  favourable angle. The most remarkable member of this particular group is undoubtedly the form
  known as <span class="sc">Venus's Girdle</span>. This species takes the form of a long,
  ribbon-like band of transparent jelly. The edges of the ribbon are clothed with vibratile hairs,
  and the mouth is situated in the centre of one of the edges. The animal progresses by the action
  of its hairs alone, or may be assisted by the twistings and undulations of its ribbon-like
  body.</p>

  class="sc">Toilet-sponges</span> of commerce represent but an insignificant fraction in comparison
  with the many hundred species which find no place in the world's market. Toilet-sponges owe their
  intrinsic value to the relative fineness and elasticity of their component fibrous skeletons. In
  these particular species the skeleton is composed of a substance akin to horn. In other sponges
  the skeleton may consist of horny fibres mixed with flinty spicules, or it may be of flint only,
  or of spicules of carbonate of lime. Finally, there are sponges which possess no internally
  supporting skeleton, fibrous or spicular, and whose substance is consequently little more than
  gelatinous. All these numerous forms, however, agree with one another in the identity of their
  most essential vital elements. In the living sponge the skeleton, fibrous or otherwise, is
  embedded within a gelatinous matrix by whose component cells it is excreted. Externally the
  sponge-body is perforated over the greater portion of its extent by minute holes or pores, while
  one or more holes of relatively large size occupy the summit of the sponge, or are scattered here
  and there among the numerous smaller pores. The smaller pores represent incurrent apertures, and
  lead to chambers within the sponge's substance lined by cells. Each of these is provided with a
  long whip-like appendage, with a transparent wineglass-shaped cup or collar, which is a
  beautifully constructed food-trap. The lashings of the whips of the collar-cells cause currents of
  water bearing nutrient particles to flow in at all the smaller pores. Arriving at the chambers,
  these particles are caught by the outstretched collar-traps and absorbed into the cell's
  substance. The water, together with rejected and waste materials given off by the sponge-body, is
  carried forward, and passes out at the larger orifices or vents.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Animalcules</span>, which represent the simplest and lowest forms of
  living animals, consist chiefly of organisms which are the equivalents of one of the single cells,
  or, as they might be termed, the "life-bricks," out of which all the higher animals, and also
  plants, are built up. They are of minute dimensions, and require the aid of the microscope for
  their proper investigation. Among the most highly organised members of this sub-kingdom mention
  must be made of the <span class="sc">Ciliated Animalcules</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Infusoria</span>, so called because they were first discovered inhabiting decaying
  vegetable and animal infusions. The so-called <span class="sc">Slipper-animalcule</span> is one of
  the commonest forms which makes its appearance amidst such environments. The length of this
  single-celled animal scarcely averages the one-hundredth part of an inch, but within this
  restricted space an amazing degree of structural and functional differentiation is included. Its
  outer surface is, in the first place, densely clothed with hairs, which represent its organs of
  locomotion. This outer cell-wall has a subjacent somewhat softer layer, in which are developed as
  crowded a series (as compared with the hairs) of minute rod-like bodies, which, under various
  stimuli, can be shot out like darts through the skin, and are adjudged to be offensive and
  defensive weapons, partaking much of the same nature as the thread- or stinging-cells of
  sea-anemones. Among other noteworthy structures, the slipper-animalcule <span class="pagenum"
  id="page766"><span class="smaller">{766}</span></span>has a distinct throat-opening, two
  rhythmically contracting cavities fulfilling a respiratory function and a complex reproductive
  nodule, or nucleus. Compared with a host of its kindred, this animalcule is a giant, the longest
  diameter of many of the smaller varieties measuring no more than the <span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5000</span>th part of inch, or even less.</p>

  <p>The elegant little <span class="sc">Bell-animalcule</span>, with its crystal wineglass-shaped
  body, crown of vibrating hairs, and long spirally contractile foot-stalk, is a familiar object to
  the possessor of a microscope. Most commonly these single-celled organisms, like the single-celled
  elements of organic tissues, multiply by repeated sub-division, the number that can be reproduced
  in a short space of time by this simple process being almost incredible. As many as a million, it
  has been calculated, of some species may be thus derived from an original single individual within
  twenty hours. In this connection these lowly organisms can among living animals most logically lay
  claim to immortality. The individual, in point of fact, never dies. Finding itself growing old and
  obese at the ripe age of, say, sixty minutes, it has simply to split itself up into two offsets,
  which swim away and repeat the process. Occasionally, for the rejuvenescence of the race, two
  individuals coalesce completely with one another, and multiplication by splitting takes place.</p>

  <p>Some near relations of the little bell-animalcule, while sub-dividing so far as their bodies
  are concerned, remain united by their foot-stalks, and thus in time build up beautiful tree-like
  structures, laden as it were with crystal bells or fruit. In some of these the common branching
  foot-stalk is erect and rigid, while in others it is flexible, and contains, as in the ordinary
  species, a central elastic ligament. Under these circumstances the whole tree-like structure, with
  its crystal bells, collapses and expands again under the slightest stimulus, and constitutes one
  of the most beautiful objects that can be viewed through the microscope.</p>

  <p>In lower forms of the infusorial animalcules one or more long, lash-like organs take the place
  of locomotive hairs. In this category are included the <span class="sc">Collar-bearing
  Animalcules</span>. Some of these build up tree-like growths by repeated sub-divisions and
  imperfect separation, after the manner of the bell-animalcules, while others excrete tubular
  dwelling-cases, inhabited by the resultants of the splitting process. Such forms can with
  difficulty be distinguished from skeletonless sponges.</p>

  <p>The animalcule <span class="sc">Noctiluca</span>, which by its countless myriads is the chief
  constituent of ocean phosphorescence, is a member of the Lash-bearing group. This noteworthy form
  invites a somewhat more extended notice. It is to the presence of the Noctiluca in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page767"><span class="smaller">{767}</span></span>countless myriads upon the
  upper stratum of the water on calm summer nights that is especially due the diffused form of
  phosphorescence which is more essentially characteristic of temperate latitudes. Under the most
  favourable of these conditions, the waves falling upon the strand leave as they retreat a
  glittering carpet of scintillating points; the oars of the passing boat seem as it were to dip
  into molten silver; while on the high seas the revolving screw or paddle of the steam-vessel
  leaves in its wake a broad, luminous track as far as the eye can reach. A glassful of water taken
  from the sea at such times immediately reveals the origin of these wonderful phenomena. Here and
  there will be seen floating minute bladder-like transparent spheres, resembling as nearly as
  possible small granules of boiled sago. Investigated more closely with the microscope, each
  individual speck will be found to exhibit a pouch-like contour, having a central furrow, from
  which the lash projects, and upon which the minute mouth-aperture opens. Irritated by agitation in
  any shape or form, the Noctilucas at once respond by, as it were, angry flashes of
  silvery-greenish light, and it is to the coruscations in their aggregate condition of many
  millions of these minute organisms that the several phenomena above recounted are produced.</p>

  <p>One other characteristic manifestation of ocean phosphorescence dependent upon the presence in
  countless numbers of these minute animalcules may be recorded. To those accustomed to a seafaring
  life the spectacle is a common one, on nights when the luminosity is most in evidence, of fishes
  following or darting away from the sides of the vessel apparently aglow themselves with phosphoric
  light, and leaving behind them, in accordance with their size, a more or less conspicuous luminous
  path in the murky waters. It is commonly supposed that such form of luminosity is emitted by the
  fishes themselves; but on closer investigation it will be found that this also is due to the
  presence of the animalcules under notice in countless numbers, which are disturbed into a sudden
  display of their phosphoric properties by the passage of the fishes through their midst. This
  light is reflected, as from a mirror, by the fishes' glittering scales, while the Noctilucas
  continue scintillating for several seconds in the path or wake through which the fishes have
  passed.</p>

  <p>There are other animalcules nearly allied to Noctilucas which sometimes occur in such vast
  abundance in both salt and fresh water as to visibly affect its character. In addition to a very
  long lash they have a girdle of vibratile hairs. The fresh-water representatives of this group are
  sometimes brilliant green, at others bright scarlet. That instance among the Biblical Egyptian
  plagues <span class="pagenum" id="page768"><span class="smaller">{768}</span></span>in which the
  water of the Nile was as it were "turned to blood, and all the fish died," has been attributed to
  a phenomenal development of these animalcules, which, on dying, polluted and putrefied the water.
  Instances of fishes being destroyed in vast quantities through a like agency throughout even
  extensive sea-areas have been occasionally recorded. While these pages are going to press an
  account has appeared in an American journal of red water caused by these flagellate animalcules,
  which occurred last July for an extent of at least 200 miles along the coast of California,
  producing with their decomposition a most sickening odour, and the death of shoals of fishes,
  octopods, sea-cucumbers, and other organisms.</p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;" class="sp0"> Flinty-shelled organisms of microscopic
      dimensions. The living animals consist of tiny specks of transparent jelly, from which radiate
      innumerable false feet of hair-like fineness.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Next to the Flagellates come the <span class="sc">Root-footed Animalcules</span>, which possess
  no mouth and no hairs or lashes, but progress by pushing out lobes of their jelly-like substance
  in any desired direction, into which the rest of the body flows. Food is picked up at any point
  with which an acceptable morsel may be brought in contact. The little gelatinous animal known as
  an <span class="sc">Am&#x0153;ba</span> is one of these. Related forms of this jelly animalcule
  secrete shells of varying form and structure. Some of these, known as <span
  class="sc">Forams</span>, are of carbonate of lime, and wonderfully like nautiluses and other of
  the higher molluscan shells in aspect. Though so minute, scarcely visible to the unassisted eye,
  they occur in the sea in such numbers as to form by their aggregations the more considerable
  ingredients of vast areas of the earth's strata, both past and present. The chalk cliffs of Albion
  and the white tenacious ooze of the broad Atlantic are thus to a large extent composed of the
  shells of minute organisms, which formerly flourished near the surface of the ocean, but sank on
  their death to its abysmal depths.</p>

  <p>The simplest of the forams fabricate shells with a single chamber, which are often elegantly
  vase- or flask-shaped. More usually, however, the shell represents the product of repeated
  buddings or outgrowths, and may attain considerable dimensions. Flattened circular forms of this
  type much resemble time-worn coins, and are hence called <span class="sc">Nummulites</span>. Their
  fossil-shells enter mainly into the composition of rocks which extend through North Africa and
  Asia to the Himalaya, and supplied the stone of which the Pyramids are built.</p>

  <p>Allied to the Forams, but distinguished by the radiating, needle-like contour of their false
  feet and the flinty texture of their shells, are an equally numerous assemblage of organisms known
  as <span class="sc">Radiolarians</span>. Like the Forams, they are inhabitants of the sea, and
  their discarded shells enter extensively into the constitution of strata. A little globular
  fresh-water form, devoid of a shell, and with slender bristle-like feet radiating in every
  direction, is known as the <span class="sc">Sun-animalcule</span>, and forms a connecting-link
  between the last two groups.</p>

  Animal Creation has now been successively portrayed. With such simple gelatinous life-specks as
